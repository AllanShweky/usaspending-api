# The USAspending Application Programming Interface (API)

The USAspending API allows the public to access data published under the DATA Act. While the API is under development, we are gradually increasing the amount of available data and the capabilities of the API. Data in the current API comes from a selection of submissions the DATA Act Data Broker and the current USASpending.gov.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

**New to APIs?** Check out our [introductory tutorial](/docs/intro-tutorial) on the API to learn the ropes

**Familiar with APIs?** Roll up your sleeves with our more technical documentation [Using the API](/docs/using-the-api), or jump right into the data with some [request recipies](/docs/recipies/)

**New to government financial data?** Check out our [data dictionary](/docs/data-dictioanry) to learn to navigate it

## Background <a name="background"></a>

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

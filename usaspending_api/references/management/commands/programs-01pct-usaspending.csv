Eligible agricultural land includes cropland; grassland; pastureland, rangeland, hayland, and other land on which food fiber, or other agricultural products are produced or capable of being legally produced for which a valid conservation plan exists and is implemented. Ineligible land is as follows: (1) Federal lands; (2) State-owned, municipal, or other local government-owned lands; (3) Native sod; and (4) Land that is already enrolled in CCC’s CRP, Wetlands Reserve Program, or Grassland Reserve Program.  Eligible crops for annual and establishment payments are renewable plant materials such as feed grains, other agricultural commodities, or other plants and trees, and algae; waste materials including vegetative waste, materials, such as woods wastes and wood residues, animal waste and byproducts, such as fats, oils, greases, and manure, food waste, and yard waste.  Ineligible crops are any crop eligible to receive payments under Title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (See 8-LP, paragraph 126 and 7-CN for Title I commodities); and  any plant that is invasive or noxious or has the potential to become invasive or noxious.  Eligible materials for matching payments include various types of renewable biomass collected or harvested directly from the land in accordance with an approved conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or an equivalent plan before transport and delivery to the biomass conversion facility.  Materials will only be eligible if USDA determines that there is no higher value use for that material within a reasonable distance of the biomass conversion facility.   

Matching payments are not available for the following products:
(1) Material that is whole grain from any crop that is eligible to receive; payments under Title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 or an amendment made by that title, including, but not limited to, barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, or wheat; honey; or material that is mohair; certain oilseeds such as canola, crambe, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower seed, soybeans, sesame seed, and sunflower seeds; peanuts; pulse crops such as small chickpeas, lentils, and dry peas; dairy products; sugar; wool; and cotton boll fiber; (2) Animal waste and by-products of animal waste including fats, oils, greases, and manure; (3) Food waste and yard waste; and (4) Algae.

All eligible material must be harvested or collected directly from the land by the eligible material owner according to a conservation, forest stewardship, or equivalent plan and be separated from the higher value product before the point of delivery.  Woody biomass harvested or collected outside of project area contracts is limited to eligible material resulting from preventative treatments to address fire fuel load reduction, insect or disease outbreaks, or restore ecosystem health.  Woody biomass harvested or collected outside of project area contracts is limited to eligible materials that do not have an existing market for non-biomass use and cannot be co-mingled with higher product value materials.  Eligible material owner, for purposes of the matching payment, means a person or entity having the right to collect or harvest eligible material, who has the risk of loss in the material that is delivered to an eligible facility and who has directly or by agent delivered or intends to deliver the eligible material to a qualified biomass conversion facility, including: (1) For eligible material harvested or collected from private lands, including cropland, the owner of the land, the operator or producer conducting farming operations on the land, or any other person designated by the owner of the land; and (2) For eligible material harvested or collected from public lands, a person having the right to harvest or collect eligible material pursuant to a contract or permit with the US Forest Service or other appropriate Federal agency, such as a timber sale contract, stewardship contract or agreement, service contract or permit, or related applicable Federal land permit or contract, and who has submitted a copy of the permit or contract authorizing such collection to CCC.  Eligible facilities are biomass conversion facilities that convert or propose to convert renewable biomass into heat, power, bio based products, or advanced biofuels and have been approved for the BCAP program by the CCC.

""}","{""description"":""In order for a delivery of eligible materials to a biomass conversion facility to qualify for a BCAP payment, the receiving biomass conversion facility must be qualified for BCAP. To become qualified, the biomass conversion facility must enter into an agreement with CCC, through the FSA State office in the State where the facility is physically located.  For any facility, whether or not yet in operation, the entity requesting that a facility become qualified must provide proof of all applicable Federal, State, local, and Tribal permits and licenses required for operation or proof of application completions or letters of renewal submissions from the applicable governmental entity. Applicable permits and licenses may include, but are not limited to, business licenses, air quality permits, water discharge permits, storm water permits, or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives registrations.  Each biomass conversion facility must enter into a separate agreement with CCC regardless of whether a single owner has multiple facilities. CCC will issue a unique facility identification number to each qualifying biomass conversion facility.  Eligible material owners must apply at an FSA county office and receive approval for that application before delivering the eligible material to the qualified biomass conversion facility.  Applications must include the following based on information obtained from contracts, agreements, or binding letters of intent: (1) An estimate of the total dry tons of eligible material expected to be sold to the qualified biomass conversion facility; (2) The type(s) of eligible material that is expected to be sold; (3) The name of the qualified biomass conversion facility that will purchase the eligible material; (4) The expected, fair market, per dry ton payment rate the owner plans to receive for the delivery of the eligible material; (5) The date or dates the eligible material is expected to be delivered to the qualified biomass conversion facility; (6) A new or amended conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan.  Eligible material owners who deliver eligible material to more than one qualified biomass conversion facility must submit separate applications for each facility to which eligible material will be delivered.  In order to enroll land for Establishment and Annual payments, the participant must enter into a contract with CCC. Only the owners, operators, or tenants of eligible land within a project area that will actually perform the work specified in the contract are eligible to apply for the program.  The contract is comprised of: (1) The terms and conditions for participation in BCAP; (2) The conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan; and (3) Any other materials or agreements determined necessary by CCC.""}","Contract approval for matching payments is subject to availability of funds and to eligible material owners completion of required conservation plan, forest stewardship plan or equivalent plan; presentation of proof of material ownership; and compliance with all eligible material provisions.  Eligible material owners accepted into the program will receive their matching payments after they provide CCC documentation of deliveries to qualified biomass conversion facilities.    Establishment payments will be made based on a determination by CCC that an eligible practice or an identifiable portion exists.  Eligible practices are practices specified in the conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan that meet all standards need to cost-effectively establish annual crops, non-wood perennial crops, and wood perennial crops.  Payments will not be more than 75 percent of the cost for establishing a perennial crop for seed and stock costs; planting costs, cost of site preparation for non-industrial forest land; could include but not limited to site preparation for non-tree planting and supplemental or temporary irrigation.  Annual payments will be calculated on a per acre basis using market-based rental rates.  Rental payment rates will be based on average soil rental rate for cropland and all other agricultural land; marginal pastureland; and for forest land.  The first years' payments will be made as an advance in an amount equal to 50 percent with 30 days of contract approval, with the remaining 50 percent being paid within 30 days of the first-year contract anniversary date.  Annual payments for subsequent years will be made within 30 days of the contract anniversary beginning with the second-year contract anniversary.  If BCAP participants collect both annual and matching payments for their crops, they are subject to a reduction in their annual payment.  The size of the reduction depends on the end use of the biomass being delivered to a biomass conversion facility.  The annual payment will be reduced by:  1 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to cellulosic biofuels as defined by 40 CFR 80.1401; by 10 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to advanced biofuels; and by 25 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to heat, power, or biobased products.","{""flag"":""contact"",""list"":[]}",Not Applicable,Determinations may be appealed in accordance with the administrative appeal regulations at parts 11 and 780 of 7 CFR.

(F) Special Research Grants Program Potato Breeding Research:

Potato Variety Development and Improvement in the Northwest

The objective of this research is to release and commercialize new potato varieties that will directly benefit all segments of the Northwest potato industry and indirectly benefit all US producing regions.  The strategy is to identify traits, make crosses, and apply selection pressures that will increase the probability of developing varieties that can be produced and utilized more efficiently than existing varieties.  Appropriate breeding goals include high yield, improved processing quality, genetic resistance to major pests and diseases, higher levels of resistance to stresses, increased nutrient use efficiency, improved human nutritional value, and high tuber quality.  An additional environmental benefit comes with reduced use of pesticides, water, and fertilizers, which are normal by-products of improved varieties.  This major objective is accompanied by myriad minor objectives involving germplasm enhancement, germplasm production, selection procedures, disease and stress screening, variety trial design and conduct, seed increases, management studies, and commercial evaluations.  Each objective is to be carried out by the Northwest institution(s) best equipped to complete the associated tasks.  A heavy element of interdependence among all institutions is essential in achieving the outlined objectives.

Potato Breeding and Cultivar Development in the Southwest

The Southwestern Regional Potato Cultivar Development Project was initiated by several universities to meet the unique needs of the Southwest potato industry.  Crosses and original selections are made in Colorado and Texas followed by formal regional evaluation trials in all three (3) states.  Breeding stocks and advanced selections are openly shared with more than a dozen other states.  Promising selections from the Project are further evaluated in the Western Regional Trials which include seven (7) Western states.  Specific goals and objectives are developed and constantly reevaluated based on extensive stakeholder input. Since the inception of the Southwestern Regional Potato Cultivar Development Project in 1997, 48 new cultivars and clonal selections have been released or co-released with other institutions which make up substantial and increasing portions of the regional potato acreage and have become important contributors to the economies of the states.  Of newly released cultivars since 1997, and ranking in the top 50 cultivars that were accepted for seed certification in the US in 2015, cultivars developed by the Southwestern Regional Potato Cultivar Development Project ranked second among the regional projects.

Development Of Multipurpose Potato Cultivars With Enhanced Quality, Disease And Pest Resistance–North Central Region

Potato production is in the North Central US is vital to the regional economy and plays an important role in the national potato supply.  In 2015 the four (4) states of Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin accounted for 22% of the US acreage, with a farm-gate value of $856 million.  All sectors of the potato market are present in this region, dominated by fry and chip processing markets, with a successful fresh market and expanding specialty market niches. Changes in climate, consumer preference, production economics, and environmental regulations require continual innovation in the potato industry, and plant breeding leading to variety commercialization is critical to meeting these evolving demands.  This proposal, which is a joint effort of the potato breeding and genetics programs at four (4) North Central land-grant universities. There are four (4) specific objectives are detailed as follows: 
(1) to identify new varieties with superior agronomics and end-used quality via hybridization and selection; 
(2) to screen elite germplasm for resistance to key pests; 
(3) to use genetic markers to improve breeding efficiency; and
(4) to transfer new varieties from the breeding programs to the commercial sector.   

The four (4) project directors and their collaborators have the requisite experience, facilities, and stakeholder relationships to successfully complete these objectives.  

The expected outcomes from the one-year grant include the release of new varieties, the selection of new breeding lines, new markers for marker-assisted selection, and preliminary data on the feasibility of using genome-wide marker analyses for improving variety development.

Potato Breeding and Variety Development for Improved Quality and Pest Resistance in the Eastern United States

This is an integrated, seven-state (Florida, Maine, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) potato breeding and variety development project for the eastern U.S.  Four (4) states maintain breeding programs. Collaborative multi-site selection, evaluation, and variety development work is conducted in all states. Breeding objectives and priorities are determined from stakeholder input. The overall goal is to develop attractive, productive, disease- and insect-resistant potato varieties that can be employed by small and large potato producers to enhance marketing opportunities, farm sustainability and profits. The specific objectives are: 
(1) Improve productivity and quality for important eastern U.S. markets by developing and releasing superior potato varieties using conventional and marker-assisted potato breeding methods; 
(2) Reduce the impact of economically important biotic and abiotic potato production constraints by breeding and developing improved potato germplasm; 
(3) Select widely-adapted potato varieties by screening yield, quality, and pest resistance traits at multiple eastern locations; 
(4) Facilitate commercial adoption of improved new varieties by coordinating initial commercial trials and by developing production management recommendations; and 
(5) Enhance the availability and use of project-related, research-based information through the use of digital media. Development of varieties with resistance to important diseases such as late blight, scab, potato virus y, early blight, and golden nematode is a long-term priority. 

The project focuses on classical breeding techniques, but also includes development and use of marker-assisted selection for key traits. Our selection procedures utilize diverse eastern growing conditions to select potato germplasm with resistance to pests, heat stress, and stress-related defects.

(H) Special Research Grants Program Aquaculture Research (aka Aquaculture Centers):

Development and Management of Canola in the Great Plains Region 

The long-term goal of this project is to facilitate the adoption of winter canola into cropping systems of the Southern Great Plains (SGP). The project will focus on the high priority areas of developing and testing of superior cultivars, improving methods of production, and transferring of new knowledge to producers. New cultivars developed under SGP conditions will possess enhanced winter survival, higher yield potential, greater oil content, and herbicide tolerance. To date, the project has released a new variety of winter canola called “Torrington”, a variety that yields 9.7% greater than the most widely grown cultivars in the SGP.  

Two (2) additional cultivars will be considered for full release in 2017. The project tested 48 varieties in FYs 2015/16, including 23 that are commercially available, and 36 in the FYs 2016/17 season. Project results can be found at http://www.agronomy.k-state.edu/services/crop-performance-tests/index.html.  In addition the team has conducted seeding studies and harvest management studies that have been published as an extension bulletin to help farmers with their management.  The team has communicated these results through 19 individual events in both Oklahoma and Kansas that reached 925 people.  

Improving Canola Production and Production Systems with Genetic and Agronomic Advances to Increase Canola Acreage in the Pacific Northwest.

Pacific Northwest (PNW) dryland agriculture is dominated by small-grain cereals due to high dryland wheat yields.  This project will aim to increase canola production in this area since it can lend sustainability to a current system of monoculture cereal production, with some of the highest canola yields in the US.  This project will develop genetically superior cultivars, identify and quantify economic and rotational benefits of integrating a canola rotation, identify management strategies, conduct surveys for the impact of blackleg disease, and produce a manual for PNW canola production. To date the team has identified and field evaluated just over 3000 genetic lines and regionally tested seven (7) advanced lines.  

The spring canola cultivar “empire” was released and foundation seed was produced for cultivar that is a fry oil and three (3) new winter cultivars with high herbicide tolerance.  The team has tested 74 regional cultivars throughout four (4) states.

The four (4) projects funded in the 2016 competition include:

(1) Why has U.S. Aquaculture Struggled Economically?  Identifying Key Current and Future Determinants of Economic Sustainability;
(2) Improving Aquaculture's Value through Enhanced Nutrient Management;
(3) Identification of the risks of emerging Flavobacteria to early life stages of farmed salmonids and development of improved control strategies; and
(4) Validation of markers and marker-assisted selection of hard clam for resistance to QPX disease.

The Hatch Act of 1887 provides the basis for Federal funding for agricultural research activities at the State Agricultural Experiment Stations in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Insular Areas.
State Agricultural Experiment Stations are eligible for funds appropriated under this Act according to the following formula: The previous year’s base plus the current year increase as follows: 
Three percent (3%) for Federal Administration, 
Twenty percent (20%) equally, 
Twenty-six percent (26%) in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allotted as the rural population of the State bears to the total rural population of all the States as determined by the last preceding decennial census; 
Twenty-six percent (26%) t in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount to be allotted as the farm population of the State bears to the total farm population of all the States as determined by the last preceding decennial census. Twenty-five percent (25%)  for the Hatch Multistate Research Fund.

(B) The Hatch Act of 1887 (Multistate Research) 
Not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total Hatch Act of 1887 funding is allotted to the States for cooperative research employing multidisciplinary approaches in which a State agricultural experiment station, working with another State agricultural experiment station, the Agricultural Research Service, or a college or university, cooperates to solve problems that concern more than one (1) State. These funds are designated as the ‘‘Multistate Research Fund, State Agricultural Experiment Stations.” Funds are allocated on a prorata basis and allocations are adjusted to support national and regional projects. These projects and their associated budgets are reviewed and approved annually.

The 25 percent applies to any amounts appropriated above the level of funding in 1955 (the base year). ",FORMULA GRANTS,Not Applicable,"(A) The Hatch Act of 1887 (Regular Research)

 (A) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2016 – HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH:

A Southern Region study was conducted to improve disease resistance and fruit quality in peaches using traditional breeding and molecular approaches because the perfect peach - consistently exceeding consumer expectations with satisfying appearance, aroma, flavor, shelf life, and texture and meeting industry needs for durable disease resistances - remains elusive. This work lead to the development and application of DNA tests, which, when combined with phenotypic data, have facilitated breeding programs combining horticultural quality with leaf resistance to bacterial spot and fruit resistance to brown rot.
A Western Region project studied Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization and infection in horses and cattle.  Investigators examined how different strains of S. aureus isolated from mastitic cows impact the outcome of mammary gland infection.  This led to a better understanding of what virulence factors are used by S. aureus to cause disease, which will guide future vaccine designs. 
A project from the North Central region investigated novel methods for soybean genetic improvement and genomic analysis.  Researchers discovered new Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for soybean seed protein and oil content, and one (1) of the QTLs greatly influences seed protein content.
(B) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2016 – HATCH MULTI-STATE RESEARCH:

A new project was initiated in FY 2016. The project will:

a) develop chemical ecology tools and information to support sustainable agriculture by reducing damage by pests in crops such as potatoes, brassicas, cucurbits, apples, blueberries, and sweet corn, while maintaining pollinator health in agricultural systems;

Fiscal Year2018: (A) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2018 – HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH:
A North Central study is investigating biocontrol of foodborne pathogens on fresh produce.  Recently, there has been an increase in the number of disease outbreaks associated with fresh produce contaminated with pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, and others.  Researchers are working to develop and optimize a bacteriophage treatment to control enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli on fresh produce.  Bacteriophages are potentially useful in controlling foodborne pathogens on minimally processed products since phage application is a non-destructive treatment.
(B) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2018 – HATCH MULTI-STATE RESEARCH:

New projects which will begin in 2018 include:

(1) Regulation of Photosynthetic Processes
Collaborators participating in this regional project will place considerable focus on understanding and improving the response of photosynthesis to genetic, developmental and environmental factors that limit productivity. The research spans all levels of organization from the molecular and cellular through the leaf, whole plant and canopy.  Particular emphasis will be placed on abiotic stresses (i.e., heat, cold, drought and salinity), nitrogen- and water-use efficiency, carbon flux pathways, and the signal transduction mechanisms that initiate the plant response.

(2) Enteric Diseases of Food Animals: Enhanced Prevention, Control and Food Safety
The long-term goal of this collaborative project is to develop strategies to prevent and control enteric diseases of cattle, swine, and poultry, ultimately to decrease the incidence of enteric diseases in food animals, and decrease zoonotic food and water-borne illnesses in the USA.

(3) Improving Forage and Bioenergy Crops for Better Adaptation, Resilience, and Flexibility
This project is directed to these focus areas: Breeding crops with higher forage yield, improved forage quality for livestock production, longevity, and resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress conditions will provide more economical food production; forage crops need to be developed that will be productive under abiotic stresses, including drought, flooding, cold and warm temperatures, and soil salinity; Research needs to be done on stand establishment (improved seed germination and seedling vigor), biomass production, disease and insect resistance, etc., across multiple environments, especially on marginal soils where these species are likely to be used without competing with food crops; and Improving the yield, nutritional quality, and storability of forage crops will ensure an ample supply of good quality feed to animals and an essential step in securing the food chain to the consumer.

(4) Elder Financial Exploitation: Family Risk and Protective Factors
This project will address five (5) objectives:
a)	understand family members' experiences (thoughts and feelings) related to elder financial exploitation by a relative;
b)	identify risk and protective factors in family systems that increase or decrease the likelihood of family elder financial exploitation;
c)	identify the range and scope of family experiences foundational to family elder financial exploitation, including the consequences of EFE on family systems;
d)	disseminate findings and implications to gerontology, family studies, and family economics researchers and educators, law enforcement and attorneys, community-based practitioners, and family members; and 
e)	continue to design further studies that build on earlier findings and create a conceptual model or expand Rabiner et al. (2004) Conceptual Model of Elder Financial Exploitation.

(5) Social, Economic and Environmental Causes and Consequences of Demographic Change in Rural America
This project proposes to undertake a comprehensive analysis of current population processes affecting U.S. rural areas and provide to stakeholders policy-relevant research findings on the demographic causes and consequences of socioeconomic and environmental change.


Fiscal Year2017: (A) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2017 – HATCH REGULAR RESEARCH:
Investigators in the Western Region are working to connect water quantity and water quality considerations in water-scarce regions of the arid southwest.  Researchers have completed a detailed analyses of water policies, including such topics as groundwater governance in the United States, the use of grey water by the building/engineering industries, and the detection of antibiotic resistance in environmental matrices, such as recycled water and grey water. This work will help to develop guidelines for the future matching of water supplies to appropriate uses.
(B) FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2017 – HATCH MULTI-STATE RESEARCH:

New projects initiated/renewed in 2017 include the following:
(1) The project will:
 a) conduct multidisciplinary conventional and molecular marker-assisted breeding, germplasm enhancement, and early-generation selection research to improve potato productivity and quality for important Eastern U.S. markets. This will help develop new potato varieties with improved disease and insect resistance, resistance to internal heat necrosis, improved processing or fresh market characteristics, and enhanced nutritional quality will be released, providing growers with better marketing opportunities and/or improved resistance to pests;
 b) use novel and improved potato germplasm to reduce the impact of economically important potato pests in the Eastern US.  This will increase adoption of new, high quality, pest resistant varieties, leading to increased profitability, greater worker safety, and reduced pesticide load in the environment and human diet;
c) evaluate yield, quality, and pest resistance of preliminary and advanced potato breeding lines in experimental- and commercial-scale trials at multiple Eastern locations to aid industry adoption of new varieties. Multi-site evaluation and selection process will result in the release of new, broadly adapted potato varieties that will be stress tolerant and suitable for use in a changing climate; and
d) provide timely and relevant information to stakeholders through various means including the maintenance of a project website and a web-based potato variety performance database for use by researchers, extension, potato growers, and allied industry members. Web-based and traditional conduits will be used for the distribution of timely and readily available potato variety production information to growers, allied industry members and consumers will be further developed and strengthened.

(2) The project will:
a) develop new technologies for characterizing fundamental nanoscale processes; 
b) construct and characterize self-assembled nanostructures that will lead to development of tools and products and benefit different aspects of agriculture and biological engineering research; 
c) develop devices and systems incorporating microfabrication and nanotechnology; 
d) develop a framework for economic, environmental and health risk assessment for nanotechnologies applied to food, agriculture and biological systems; 
e) develop/improve education and outreach materials on nanofabrication, sensing, systems integration and application risk assessment; and
 f) improve academic-industry partnership to help move the developed technologies to commercialization phase.

Examples of research on continuing projects include:
(1) The project will:
a) develop new technologies for management of flies (biting and nuisance) in organic and conventional animal agriculture systems. This include in depth evaluation of the natural repellents used on livestock and further understand of how flies respond to repellents. Develop and evaluate recognition software to estimate fly population densities on livestock. Provide recommendations for alternative bedding materials to minimize fly development and optimal trapping strategies for target species; 
b) detect Insecticide resistance and develop management strategies. Produce research and extension publications describing the mechanism(s) of resistance to insecticides in house flies, stable flies and horn flies. A database of resistance mechanisms by fly species and geographic distribution will be made available to support management efforts directed at house flies and stable flies. Develop a publicly-accessible database of the house fly and stable fly genomes that can be queried by fly researchers from various scientific disciplines;
c) investigate microbial ecology, epithelial immunity, and vector competence of biting and nuisance flies. Identification of attractive and repellent compounds from stable fly larval development substrates and from bacteria associated with flies and their development sites. Attractive lures will be developed and tested based upon fly response to these compounds. A database of bacterial, viral, and fungal taxa associated with blow flies will be developed. Produce research and extension publications describing infection of house flies by bacteria and other pathogens of concern to humans. Evaluate, develop and recommend selected essential oils with documented antimicrobial or microstatic activity against mastitis in dairy cattle; 
d) characterize population biology of biting and nuisance flies. Datasets will be produced and made available describing the dispersal distance of stable flies with additional recorded data on environmental factors that affect dispersal. A population growth model for stable fly using time-series datasets will be provided to collaborators for use in further research or extension to growers and other extension clientele. A database of larval development site characteristics will be produced and made available; and
e) community and stakeholder engagement by developing a searchable, national database of all pesticides registered in the US for use in animal agriculture will be compiled and updated annually. A national website with links to all currently available livestock entomology research and extension information from across the US will be made available to our stakeholders. Collaborate on developing regular state, regional and national updates for user groups (Extension agents, producer groups, veterinarians, etc.) through conference calls and/or on-line conferencing utilities. We will conduct pest specific webinars for farmers/stakeholders (conventional and organic), private practitioners.

This proposal examines the marketing capabilities of small farmers who engage in agritourism activities as a supplemental or primary means of earnings, and seeks to provide research based measures to improve the marketing viability of such farms. Research activities will lead to the identification of current and potential small farm agritiourism practitioners and the marketing challenges they face in developing and communicating agritourism experiences and resources. The identification of the ""gaps"" in agritourism marketing among small farmers will provide an opportunity for these farmers to develop marketing strategies and resources and in procuring the financial support or technical expertise needed to further develop their agritourism enterprises. As a result of this initial set of research activities, a set of ""best practices"" in agritourism marketing will be identified. These best practices will be formulated as a training resource to be delivered via, workshops, web-based curricula and outreach training for agritourism practitioners.
 
IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF VIRUSES INFECTING SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX L.) AND LIMA BEAN (PHASEOLUS LUNATUS) USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING

Plant diseases caused by fungi, oomycetes, bacteria and viruses are one (1) of the main limiting factors affecting agriculture and food safety security worldwide. This proposal aims to identify and characterize viruses infecting two (2) important legume crops including soybean (Glycine max L.), and lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus). Through this project, researchers will apply NGS to explore the presence of RNA viruses infecting soybean and lima beans. Following discovery of any viral or viral-like sequences, scientists will design probes/primers for identifying RNA plant viruses for field surveys. Finally, they will develop and utilize for the routine detection for the identified viruses. Providing this information will improve knowledge about future disease management strategies of plant viruses. Identifying and characterizing new/emerging diseases is becoming more important as international trade of plant products increases and as trading partners seeks to protect themselves from the introduction of unwanted diseases.

LOW-FAT FRIED MUSCLE FOODS AND HUMAN HEALTH ENHANCEMENT: A THREE-PRONG STRATEGY

Fried foods have become a health concern and high consumption of fried foods has been associated with health conditions such as heart diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, premature aging and cancer.  Hence, to address this problem, researchers propose to devise a three-prong strategy (a novel protein-based edible coating prepared from fish and chicken processing by-products activated with onion peel extract, and a new battering system consisting of sweet potato starch) to reduce the fat-uptake in deep-fat fried muscle foods. The specific objectives of this study are to: 

(1) Isolate the proteins from fish and chicken processing by-products and develop edible coatings;
(2) Determine the effect of sweet potato starch-containing batter alone or in combination with edible coating on reducing the fat-uptake of fried muscle foods; 
(3) Evaluate the physicochemical properties of the fried muscle foods during refrigerated storage; 
(4) Investigate the antibacterial activities of the edible coating containing onion peel extract against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria; 
(5) Analyze sensory attributes of the fried muscle foods during refrigerated storage; and
(6) Provide experiential and educational opportunities for minority students through undergraduate and graduate research assistantships.







Fiscal Year2016: For FY 2016:

Integrated Control Of Spotted Wing Drosophila, Drosophila Suzukii, In Sustainably Grown Blackberries - The goals/objectives of this project are to: Determine if habitat management/native perennial plantings in a farmscaping approach to enhance beneficial insect diversity and abundance, application of Entrust, and GRANDEVO reduces Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD) abundance and damage in blackberries. These studies will: 
(1) quantify populations of beneficial insects (i.e., lady beetles, lacewings, anthocorids, lygaeids and carabids) and SWD in sustainably grown blackberries with and without native perennial border plantings; 
(2) assess control of SWD and quantify berry damage; and
(3) determine if biologically based products (i.e., Entrust and GRANDEVO) reduce SWD abundance and damage in blackberries in grower cooperator plots. The project will also educate berry growers about results of this research and assist incorporating positive results into their control programs. 

Financially Literate Entrepreneurship For Rural Youth And Families: A Pilot Study At Two County High Schools - A pilot study that examines, identifies, and supports solutions to the economic challenges specific for youth and their families in rural communities will be conducted under this project.  While entrepreneurship programs are in place in some communities, most American youth have little access to comprehensive financial literacy training to support successful entrepreneurship. The primary goal of the pilot study is to improve rural youth and their families' economic and employment situations by providing quality education in entrepreneurship and financial literacy. Five core objectives will be addressed:
(1) building an infrastructure for ongoing community development; 
(2) growing learning opportunities for youth and adults in rural communities;
(3) encouraging community investment in rural-based entrepreneurs; 
(4) reducing challenges faced by youth entrepreneurs; and 
(5) sharing the methodologies. 

These objectives will be measured over the three-year term of the grant.

Techniques To Improve Calcein Marking Of Fish - The ability to discriminate between wild and hatchery produced fish following stock enhancement is critical to a benefit cost analysis. Calcein represents a non-lethal means of distinguishing among groups of fish following an enhancement stocking.  The overall goal of this project is to determine efficacy of using calcein to mark Black Crappie and White Crappie. The studies outlined below in the objectives are needed to achieve the overall goal. The objectives of the project are to: 
(1)conduct range-finding tests to determine the no observable effect concentrations and 3.5-min LC50s for salt in Black Crappie and White Crappie; 
(2) conduct focused salinity tolerance tests to reduce the standard errors of estimates of the no observable effect concentrations and 3.5-min LC50s for salt in Black Crappie and White Crappie;
(3) determine the maximum dunking density tolerable to Black Crappie and White Crappie; and 
(4) determine the retention rates and relative intensities of calcein marks on Black Crappie and White Crappie over a period of months to years following marking.




 OPTIMAL AGRONOMIC PRACTICES TO REDUCE NUTRIENT LOADING IN WATER BODIES

The research objectives for this three-year project include the following:
(1) Develop a GIS based methodology to assess statewide agronomic practices in a dynamic manner in collaboration with different agencies and institutions. This effort will produce a GIS data base of the agronomic practices of farmers in the watershed that will include variables such as time lines for tillage, fertilizing, planting, applications of chemicals for crop health and harvesting. The yield output cost input data would be included. Historic data on farmers; management practices with regard to tillage, fertilization, crop health, residue management will be captured through this effort with the ability to summarize the practices of individual famers in the area. Small and disadvantaged farmers will be identified and the characteristics will be documented in the study;
(2) Develop an integrated methodology to study the impacts of hydrology on nutrient loading under the current agronomic practices. This effort will result in generating a GIS based, monthly rainfall predictive model using stochastic hydrology adjusted for climate change scenarios under prescribed levels of reliability around timelines of agronomic events such as tillage, fertilizing and other chemical applications; and
(3) Develop a methodology for comparatively studying the contributions to nutrients from different sources – farms, municipal wastewater plants, discharges from industries.

ANALYZING THE ROLE OF HIGH PRO-INFLAMMATORY DIETS AND CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN THE RISK OF ADULT CARCINOGENESIS IN CHILDREN

This project was designed to better understand the relationship between pro-inflammatory diets, pro-inflammatory marker expression levels, and adult cancer risk in obese children. The central hypothesis of this study is that high pro-inflammatory diets and lack of exercise, which are obesity precursors, will result in increased levels of bio-inflammatory markers that have been linked to cancer diagnosis. The study proposes to address our goal in two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To investigate the link between childhood obesity caused by pro-inflammatory (high-fat) diets and low physical activity as risk factors for carcinogenesis; we will measure the expression and functionality of pro-inflammation biomarkers (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL12b, IL-10, TNF &alpha; leptin, VEGF, adiponectin, CRP, and SAA); and Specific Aim 2: To determine cancer risks by investigating differences in the pro-inflammatory gene signature according to demographics and socioeconomic status in racially-diverse populations (varying degrees of rurality, age, gender, income, and educational level) by data stratification.  Accomplishments to-date for this three (3) year project are: Specific Aim 1: Preliminary data has been collected that compares the expression of the inflammation markers in non-cancer vs. prostate cancer DNA. There is evidence of marked increased expression in the inflammation markers, Serum amyloid A and C-Reactive Protein (SAA1 and CRP).

INVESTIGATIONS ON FOOD DERIVED AGES (ADVANCED GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS) IN RELATION TO OBESITY AND BREAST CANCER

Finding a cure for breast cancer is a national priority.  The goals of this research over a two-year period are to:

(1) Investigate the implications of carbohydrate and fat mediated modifications termed as Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) in relation to obesity (BMI&gt;30), and ductal carcinoma breast cancer (known age and BMI values). This will help in early detection of breast cancer, obesity involvement and some predictions about the possible types of medications for prevention of ductal carcinoma type breast cancer. The results of our studies will help us understand the implications of glycoxidation reactions in obesity and ductal carcinoma type breast cancer; and

(2) Involves undergraduate students in biomedical research. This will help student interns pursue career goals in the fields of food, nutrition and health. Two (2) to three (3) students are working in this project. Student participants work with sensitive analytical instruments, interpret the data, write research papers, and present these works in local and national scientific conferences. The research work in majority cases involve handling of important biological specimens of obese, cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples of known BMI values from similar age groups of people.

Example of funded Research in Swine –

NOVEL PORCINE EPIDEMIC DIARRHEA VIRUS VACCINE PIPELINE
 
Recent emergence of extremely contagious Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV) with 80-100% mortality in neonate pigs calls for the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine. PED has been such an important disease that it brought attention to the NIFA Animal Health and Disease priority area (A1221). In this seed grant proposal, we propose to develop an effective novel vaccine candidate against PEDV infection. We will produce a ferritin nanoparticle immunogen coated with PEDV's spike (S) glycoprotein to induce neutralizing antibodies. We will formulate this novel nanoparticle into a Newcastle virus (NDV) vector with mucosal tropism derived from an attenuated vaccine strain LaSota. The NDV vector is effective in inducing protective immunity at both the mucosal and systemic levels and it has been extensively used to express various antigens of important viral diseases including the full-length spike glycoprotein of SARS coronavirus. Resultant vector vaccines have shown safe and protective efficacies in different animal models, and NDV vector replication in eggs is amenable to large scale and rapid production. We hypothesize that the nanoparticle vaccine delivered by NDV vector mimic native viruses, which in turn elicit high titer neutralizing antibody responses and provide protection against PEDV infection in pigs. We propose to employ a pregnant sow model to test this hypothesis. Sow model is of clinical relevance because successful vaccination of sows is likely to play an important role in the control and eradication of PED epidemics in piglets.

Example of funded research in Feeder Cattle –

ALTERING THE TIME OF VACCINATION AGAINST RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS TO ENHANCE VACCINE EFFICACY, HEALTH, AND PERFORMANCE OF FEEDER CATTLE 

The focus of this research project is to compare the effects of anticipated (15 days prior), delayed (15 days after), or vaccination at the time of weaning and feedlot entry on vaccine efficacy, health, and performance variables of feeder cattle.


Example of funded research in Dairy Cattle –

ENHANCING DISEASE RESISTANCE IN DAIRY CATTLE 

The long term goal of this project is to reduce the use of antimicrobials in dairy cattle by providing new methods to optimize innate immunity through nutritional and/or targeted pharmacological approaches during time of increased susceptibility to disease. Many dairy cattle diseases during the early lactation period can result from dysfunctional inflammatory responses that are characterized by an imbalance of the robust initial response needed for pathogen clearance and the prompt return to immune homeostasis. The initiation and resolution of the inflammatory response is regulated by the production of potent lipid mediators. The potential benefits of reducing inflammatory-based diseases of early lactation dairy cattle through modification of lipid metabolism has not been explored in depth. Therefore, the immediate goals of this project are to not only identify how lipid mediator biosynthesis changes during the transition period and during disease, but also the potential impact that lipid metabolism has on macrophage inflammatory functions. Therefore, the objectives of this project are to:
(1) describe changes in lipid mediator biosynthesis during the transition period;
(2) describe changes in lipid mediator biosynthesis during mastitis; and 
(3) determine the underlying mechanisms of how lipid mediators can impact macrophage inflammatory functions.

Example of funded research in Poultry –

SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE NEXT GENERATION VACCINES AGAINST INFECTIOUS VIRUSES USING ESTABLISHED IMMORTAL AVIAN CELL LINES 

The goal of this proposal is to improve animal health by developing an optimal system for the production of infectious vaccine viruses of genetically engineered-, non-reversible and live attenuated vaccines using established immortal avian cell lines. The specific objectives are to: 
(1) attenuate virulent and vaccine virus strains using immortal avian cell lines;  
(2) develop a new reverse genetics system retaining the complete full length sequence of viral RNA genome of vaccine strain using a novel artificial bacterial chromosome (BAC) vector and immortal avian cell line substrates to produce vaccine candidates; 
(3) compare commercial vaccines with the newly generated vaccines in this project in terms of immunogenic activity and protective efficacy; and 
(4) produce a large quantity of optimally infectious vaccine strains for the use of vaccination in commercial setting.

Example of funded research in sheep –

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS AND PREGNANCY HEALTH IN SHEEP 

The overall objective of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms whereby bisphenolic compounds (BPA, and BPA replacement chemicals) with estrogenic potential can induce placental dysfunction during pregnancy. Studies described in this proposal will test a novel hypothesis to assess the disease risk of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy in a relevant agricultural species, such as the sheep. 

Objectives:
(1) to test if gestational exposure to BPA or BPA replacement compounds leads to a disruption in the maternal endocrine milieu and fetal growth in sheep; 

(2) to test if gestational exposure to BPA or BPA replacement compounds leads to a disruption in placental function; and 

(3) to test if exposure to BPA or BPA replacement compounds impairs placental steroidogenic potential.

A university is leading a project to develop the “Excellence in Education for Food, Energy, and Water (E2FEW)” project, which will support the development, implementation, and evaluation of a 24-month sustained professional development program for postsecondary food, agricultural, natural resources, and human (FANH) sciences faculty.  The faculty development program is
designed around core tenets of effective undergraduate STEM instruction, including active learning, scientific teaching strategies, and the use of Undergraduate Learning Assistants.

A university was funded to: 
(1) improve the quality and relevance of fiber, textile, and apparel (FTA) curriculum and promote enhanced curriculum and instructional materials and methods; 
(2) attract, recruit, and retain more qualified and diverse
students for the FTA sector; and 
(3) prepare graduates with the knowledge and skills to meet current and future workplace needs.

A university was funded to expand the opportunities within its Urban Food Systems Master’s degree-level program in
agriculture to include competencies (soft skills) in communication, problem solving, professionalism, teamwork, and leadership.

A university is leading a project to strengthen animal welfare education in the veterinary curriculum, with emphasis on food
animal production. Project objectives include development of: 
(1) an online 1-credit animal welfare course suitable for freshman level veterinary students; 
(2) animal welfare case studies suitable for integration in advanced veterinary courses; 
(3) 1-week rotations for swine and dairy cattle animal welfare assessment; 
(4) effective multiple-choice examination questions to evaluate student competency; and 
(5) a ""roadmap"" of existing educational opportunities to facilitate veterinary student specialization in animal welfare.

A university was funded to lead a project that addresses the need to be ready and capable of solving global food security and hunger problems that span geo-political borders. The instructional opportunity addressed by this project is to reach graduate students in food and agricultural sciences by globalizing the curricula with contextually-rich reusable learning elements (RLEs) and authentic case studies.  Instruction will be created in three (3) broad areas (Global Horticulture, Sustainable International Development, Human Health and Nutrition) with content experts creating the materials.

The student experiential learning is a tool to cultivate and develop the next generation of scientist, leaders and increase the opportunities to support the future highly-skilled workforce needs of the food and agriculture sector, including the area of Food Safety.
LEADERS: A collaborative project between an institution in Texas and another one in New Mexico focuses on improving underrepresented student success at animal science programs to become well-rounded leaders who address food security. The purpose of this project is to increase numbers of Hispanic leaders in animal science by developing experiential learning activities that increase retention and graduation rates and enhance scientific skills and professional development of an audience of underrepresented B.S. (n=15) and M.S. (n=10) students. The LEADERS program will produce experienced underrepresented graduates who are well qualified to enter the work force and provide human capital necessary to enhance the nation’s food supply.
BE AWARE: This project proposes five thrust activities: (1) attracting, recruiting and retaining students; (2) implementing a novel multidisciplinary career development and mentoring model; (3) provide students with inter-institutional laboratory exchanges and experiential learning; (4) developing workshops and seminars; and (5) developing instructional material. The beneficiaries are minority students enrolled at institutions in Texas and Puerto Rico, students from Community Colleges, faculty members from HSIs and USDA-ARS/FS agencies. The students supported in Year 2 (2016-2017) are 15 at the Associate of Science level, 6 at the Bachelor of Science level, 4 at the Master of Science/Doctoral level.
IFSEEN: Based on the progress and foundation established in Year 1, the IFSEEN consortium is going to enhance the created educational linkage for collaboratively generating future Hispanic food safety/science professionals and leaders. The IFSEEN team will continue:
 (1) to attract, retain and graduate underrepresented students in food and agricultural sciences;
 (2) to strengthen institutional educational capacities to serve the needs of students in the four HSIs;
 (3) to strengthen research capabilities;
 (4) to facilitate collaboration and partnership among the four HSIs, USDA agencies, agricultural institutions and external scientists;
 (5) to build the network of Hispanic students and professionals of food science. To accomplish these objectives in Year 2, the IFSEEN team will continue to outreach to local high schools, develop new course materials, target incoming students and train them as cohorts as they matriculate through their undergraduate education. The IFSEEN program further promote activities including “career in scientific research” academic advising, cross-disciplinary laboratory technique courses, food science laboratory research with mentors at the four HSIs, external summer internship at USDA agencies and Tier 1 agricultural institutions, presenting at national conferences, and attending workshops.

Southwest Natural Resource Career Track Program: This Collaboration proposal is a partnership among 12 Hispanic Serving Institutions in the southwest focused on the USDA Priority Area of Natural Resources and Climate Change. We address the primary USDA educational need area of student experiential learning by mentoring students in our Southwest Natural Resource Career Track (NRCT) Program to prepare them for careers in natural resource management. This program will serve a minimum of 44 undergraduate
& 6 graduate students annually across partner institutions. 

Experiential Training in Use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Technology For Agriculture Applications Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi

The primary purpose of this four-year interdisciplinary multi-HSI project is to increase the number of south Texas students graduating from 2-yr Associate-granting institutions (DMC, TSTC) transitioning to 4-yr Bachelor of Science and Master’s degrees (TAMUCC, TAMUK, UTRGV) in fields related to the agricultural, plant and biological sciences.  Faculty and staff at partner institutions will provide undergraduate and graduate training and education in the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology for precision farming in agriculture. Targeted coursework will be created to include two (2) permanent on-line introductory courses in UAV technology and ethics and one (1) blended (on-line/hands-on) course in UAS applications. Training will include internships and assistance in research projects aligned with UAS as a tool for crop/soil management, plant and natural resource sciences. Products will produce 28 Bachelor of Science and 11 Masters of Science graduates working in food, agriculture, and natural resources related fields. This project will also affect 48 students from two-year academic institutions. Educational needs areas addressed by this project include: (1) curricula design in terms of development of new courses of study and (5) student experiential learning.

Texas State University will complete the EverGreen’s goal is to increase the number of Hispanic students with advanced technical degrees at the food-water-energy intersection. To meet this goal, we will train a diverse future workforce with the leadership and cross-disciplinary skills in science, technology and innovation to solve today’s complex agricultural problems – specifically those due to a changing climate, widespread food insecurity, and the lack of available water. Hispanic students will be recruited from Palo Alto College and San Antonio College to seamlessly transition into and complete degrees at Texas State University. Forty-four Hispanic students will receive personalized support through mentorships, tutoring, and professional development, as well as financial assistance through scholarships and paid internships. Through the collective attainment of 16 associate, 16 bachelor, and 12 Master of Science degrees, students will be prepared to enter positions in well-paid, technical jobs in agricultural-related fields.
Fiscal Year2017: 

San Diego State University aims to provide solutions to food security through interdisciplinary collaborations and development of a career pipeline in the fields of food and agriculture. We will build lecture and laboratory curricula around a traditional Milpa (multispecies interplanting farm) while simultaneously introducing modern urban agriculture and scientific instrumentation. Students will work alongside indigenous farmers in Oaxaca, document and preserve traditional farming techniques. The hands-on experiences will enhance academic excellence while providing marketable skills that address the food security challenge. The recognition of scientific and cultural importance of Milpa will attract underrepresented and Latino students and incentivize their career choice in agriculture.

Texas A M- Kingsville will conduct the LEADERS 2 the Doctorate project that focuses on increasing underrepresented student success by becoming well-rounded leaders prepared to address needs related to animal health, production, and well-being.  The purpose of this project is to increase the number of Hispanic leaders in animal science by developing experiential learning activities that increase retention/graduation rates, enhance scientific skills, and develop professionalism of an audience of underrepresented B.S. (n=20), M.S. (n=8), and Ph.D. (n=2) students. The LEADERS 2 program will produce experienced underrepresented graduates who are qualified to obtain advanced degrees, enter the work force as leaders in their field, and provide human capital necessary to enhance the nation’s food supply. Program objectives will be met with our unique ‘university exchange program’, ‘summer research internships’, student research opportunities, leadership/soft skill development, conference participation, language development/teambuilding workshops, and collaborative, partnerships between HSI animal science programs and faculty from Ph.D. granting institutions.

To comply with this provision, NIFA has determined that applicants must provide at least 25 percent of total project resources on an in-kind basis during the term of the grant award. The Federal share of FSLC costs can be no more than 75 percent of total project costs.  CFP, PP and FSCL grantees may provide matching funds through cash and/or in-kind contributions, including third-party in-kind contributions fairly evaluated, including facilities.  The non-federal share of the funding may come from state government, local government, other non-profit entities, or private sources.  Examples of qualifying matching contributions may include direct costs such as:  rent for office space used exclusively for the funded project; duplication or postage costs; and staff time from an entity other than the applicant for job training or nutrition education.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTES: \r\n\r\n(1) Use of Indirect Costs as In-Kind Matching Contributions. Indirect costs may be claimed under the Federal portion of the award budget or, alternatively, indirect costs may be claimed as a matching contribution (if no indirect costs are requested under the Federal portion of the award budget). However, unless explicitly authorized in the RFA, indirect costs may not be claimed on both the Federal portion of the award budget and as a matching contribution, unless the total claimed on both the Federal portion of the award budget and as a matching contribution does not exceed the maximum allowed indirect costs or the institution’s negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is less. An awardee may split the allocation between the Federal and non-Federal portions of the budget only if the total amount of indirect costs charged to the project does not exceed the maximum allowed indirect costs or the institution’s negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is less. For example, if an awardees' indirect costs are capped at 22 percent pursuant to section 1462(a) of NARETPA (7 U.S.C. 3310(a)), the awardee may request 11 percent of the indirect costs on both the Federal portion of the award and as a matching contribution. Or, the awardee may request any similar percentage that, when combined, does not exceed the maximum indirect cost rate of 22 percent.

 The MPS Farm Project and The Farm at Nellie Stone
The MPS Farm Project is a model for engaging students, teachers and the community in growing food and building healthy food skills. Youth Farm, along with our key partners Minneapolis Public Schools Culinary &
Nutrition Services (MPS) and Nellie Stone Johnson Community School (NSJ) are partnering to focus on four (4) goals: 
(1) Increase understanding of food production and nutrition among youth and teachers through agricultural education, classroom lessons and school meals; 
(2) Increase community understanding of food production, purchasing and preparation through nutrition education and engagement in the farm project to support community health and self-reliance; 
(3) Increase access to diverse, healthy food options in order to support healthy Minneapolis communities; and
(4) Create a scalable and replicable partnership model for supporting school communities in food, nutrition, youth development and agricultural education. 

The MPS Farm Project and The Farm at Nellie Stone will be developed over the course of five (5) years, engaging students and teachers at NSJ, teachers and school garden coordinators throughout the MPS district, Youth Farm, youth, and community members from Hawthorne and surrounding neighborhoods. These partners will collaboratively build a 23-acre farm and outdoor education space, including a greenhouse and hoop house, creating food access and developing a model for partner schools that connects the farm, the cafeteria, and the classroom through experiential education that aligns with MPS standards and Youth Farm’s youth development model.


Integrating Workforce Training For Foster Youth With A Community Food Web: Culinary Arts, Agriculture, and Nutrition (I-Can)

The proposed project is designed to develop and maintain a network of services to assist young adults recently emancipated from the foster care system, and brings together the resources of a large comprehensive university, an arboretum, a non-profit social enterprise, and a NIFA-funded community-based education and research project. The goals of the program are to: 
(1) to increase knowledge and skills of sustainable urban agriculture,;
(2) increase knowledge and practice of Dietary Guidelines for Americans in coordination with increasing culinary skills;  
(3) to develop business and entrepreneurial skills through the creation, testing, and sale of value-added products based on fruits and vegetables from the arboretum; and 
(4) to embed community-based research into the evaluation of the program.


Healthy Here: Bernalillo County Community Food Projects And Mobile Food Market
Presbyterian Healthcare Services will serve as the backbone agency for a collective impact partnership to address food insecurity and health disparities in Bernalillo County, New Mexico. Organization partners include Agri-Cultura Network, Adelante, Kids Cook!, Street Food Institute, and First Choice Community Healthcare. Partners along with a community-based Governance Committee will plan and carry out a four-year project incorporating a Mobile Food Market that sells locally grown produce and integrates outreach and education about cooking, nutrition, and gardening. Target beneficiaries are low-income residents of the South Valley and the International District. Residents here face challenges affording healthy produce and may not have ready transportation to reach the limited number of supermarkets and other retailers selling produce. The Mobile Food Market will stop at points of community intersection like schools, clinics, and senior centers. Programming also includes public workshops about gardening and food and a train-the trainer model to produce Community Food Leaders. The project will also employ area residents as trained Community Food Educators. Project goals include increasing access to nutritious food among low-income residents; developing local leadership and food security; supporting local farming of high-value crops and agricultural economic development; improving healthy eating and reducing area health disparities; and strengthening linkages between agricultural, entrepreneurial, health, and human service sectors to create a vibrant local food economy.

Rebuilding Local Food Systems in Farmworker Communities Project
The Farmworker Association of Florida, a community-based organization, proposes to expand its Rebuilding Local Food Systems (RLFS) in Farmworker Communities project, whose goal is trifold: to increase small-scale food production in farmworker communities; to increase low-income community members’ access to and consumption of affordable, organic foods; and to raise low income community members’ awareness about the importance of producing and consuming fresh fruits and vegetables that are locally grown using methods that conserve natural resources. Toward this goal, the RLFS project has three (3) distinct objectives: 
(1) to establish/improve community gardens in four (4) farmworker communities to serve as small-scale agriculture demonstration sites to exemplify potential farm economic development opportunities; 
(2) to develop/implement a food and farm entrepreneur program to provide education and technical assistance to community members on becoming small farmers by establishing backyard farm operations or forming agricultural cooperatives; and 
(3) to provide sustainable agriculture, nutrition, and healthy living education to farm worker families and other low-income persons in the target communities. 

The primary beneficiaries and engaged populations of the RLFS project are minority, low-income residents of the agricultural areas of South Apopka, Fellsmere, Pierson, and Homestead/Florida City. The Rebuilding Local Food Systems project aligns well with the following Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program (CFPCGP) objectives and/or priorities: meet the food needs of low-income individuals; increase the self-reliance of communities in providing for the food needs of the communities; and promote comprehensive responses to local food access, farm, and nutrition issues.
Fiscal Year2017: Buffalo Community Food Hub Project will engage low-income community members, creating a neighborhood food hub, supporting market gardens, a Mobile market, job training and greater healthy food access
The Massachusetts Avenue Project (MAP) and Grassroots Gardens of Western NY (GGWNY) will partner to implement the Buffalo Community Food Hub Project (BCFHP). Building leadership among low-income youth, new Americans and community gardeners in Buffalo, NY, the project will increase food self-reliance of Buffalo residents, promote comprehensive responses to local food and nutrition issues and meet the food needs of low-income people. A new Farmhouse and Community Food Training Center will be established at MAP's urban farm on Buffalo's West Side that will serve as a neighborhood food hub and support the creation of market gardens and new market opportunities for local growers, food-based employment and training for disadvantaged youth, greater food access thru Mobile Market expansion, food preparation and preservation education and community organizing to support school and municipal policy in support of local procurement and greater food equity.

Da Bus Mobile Market and Food Pantry
Da Bus Mobile Market and Food Pantry Project is a three (3) year initiative of The Kohala Center and Hawaii Island Food Alliance to address food insecurity and health disparities on Hawaii Island. The project goals are to improve access to affordable healthy food among low-income residents; build target area community involvement in addressing food security; support local agricultural development; improve healthy eating and reduce health disparities in chronic diseases; and strengthen linkages between agricultural, entrepreneurial, health, and human service sectors to create a secure local food economy. To achieve these goals the project will provide for a Mobile Market which will distribute locally-grown produce, staple food items, seeds, and garden starts to low-income residents on Hawaii Island; integrate outreach education on cooking, nutrition, and gardening; provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Outreach materials and services; and serve as an emergency food pantry. The Mobile Market will stop at designated community gathering sites in low-income/low-access rural areas including senior centers, low-income housing complexes, and County Park and Recreation centers. Project partners include non-profits, health institutions, university agricultural extension agents and nutritionists, farmers, and local grocers. The project is in alignment with CFPCGP goals by directly addressing the needs of low-income individuals with limited access to healthy food through a long-term solution to food distribution; increasing community self-reliance and encouraging healthy lifestyle development through gardening and cooking classes; and increasing the economic viability of the local food economy by supporting local farmers and grocers.

Farms to Food Banks Capacity-Building Project
The Farms To Food Banks Capacity Building Project will reduce food insecurity in Kentucky and strengthen the linkages between key sectors of Kentucky's food system, including farmers, nonprofit food distributors and low-income consumers. Outcomes include increasing the amount of fresh produce distributed to low income Kentuckians by 9 million, increasing by 20% the number of food bank patrons that are aware of the benefits of healthy eating and possessing the skill necessary to prepare fruits and vegetables; and increasing by 200 the number of Kentucky farmers benefitting from a new market for Number 2-grade and surplus produce and an average increase in cash flow of $2,500.00. The goals and outcomes will be received by providing equipment, such as walk-in coolers and air filtration systems, necessary for safe distribution of fresh produce by food banks and food pantries, by paying farmers to help cover their costs of picking, packing and delivering fresh produce to food banks, and by providing nutrition education services to low-income patrons of food banks and food pantries. Low-income individuals were involved in program planning and will be actively engaged in program implementation by serving as paid evaluation assistants. The self-reliance of Kentucky communities will be increased by supporting Kentucky farmers working to diversify their production from tobacco to fruits and vegetables. Ultimately, the project will help Kentucky do a better job feeding itself.

Community to Gardens and Back Again: Feeding Laramie Valley`s community-engaged and driven project to increase sustainable, equitable access to fresh, healthy food in Albany County, Wyoming
Community to Gardens and Back Again: Feeding Laramie Valley's community-engaged and driven project to increase sustainable, equitable access to fresh, healthy food in Albany County, Wyoming.  Feeding Laramie Valley (FLV) is a nonprofit organization located in the high elevation, rural community of Albany County, Wyoming. Headquartered in Laramie since its inception in 2009, FLV leads and facilitates collaborative community projects for sustainable food security, collecting and producing fresh fruits and vegetables for distribution to local residents who do not have sufficient access to enough fresh food to live a healthy life, in an effort to address the fact that Albany County has the highest food insecurity rate in Wyoming. The goals of a Community Food Project for Feeding Laramie Valley, are designed to create a sustainable, long term approach to addressing food security in Albany County, Wyoming; to open avenues for greater community voice and power in the local food system; to increase the availability of fresh, locally-produced, healthy, affordable food; reduce the high incidence of food insecurity in communities touched by FLV projects; increase awareness and understanding of the connection between fresh produce and improved health; and to forge stronger community ties and networking among gardeners, farmers, entrepreneurs, volunteers, food system. Plans to accomplish these goals include expansion of community and backyard.


Richmond Healthy Corner Store Initiative Expansion Project (RCHD)
In the first year of the proposed Healthy Corner Stores Sustainability Project, RCHD and its partner, Shalom Farms, a nonprofit which is currently the sole distributor of produce to Healthy Corner Stores, will introduce new approaches for produce aggregation, storage, and distribution with a small subset of stores in order to determine the best long-term market-driven ""free market""-based model for corner stores in Richmond. In the remaining two (2) project years, RCHD and Shalom will onboard and/or transition all Healthy Corner Stores to the new model, creating a streamlined system by which produce from regional farmers is aggregated, stored, and distributed to corner stores through well-established retailers and intermediaries, primarily Rudy's Exotic Mushrooms and Produce. By 2020, the proposed project will transform corner store-based food access work in Richmond from a public health intervention reliant on grant funding for operation to a financially lucrative partnership between vendors and store owners which will sustain mutual investment, spur additional store owners and vendors to participate in future years, and ensure access to a variety of fresh, local produce in Richmond's communities of greatest need.

Building A Community-Based Research Plan At Tohono O’odham Community College

This two-year, Pathways to Research proposal will support a partnership with University of Arizona and meetings to develop an Indigenous Research program at the college. Project directors will reach out to students and the greater community to learn about what they would support in a new research program that is adapted to the needs of the Tohono O`odham Reservation. 

IAIA Student Agricultural Research Project Phase II

This two-year Student Research project builds on a previous program to provide arts students with an opportunity to study science. Working with New Mexico State University, IAIA will train students in agriculture research methods applicable to farms along the Rio Grande and Pecos River corridors. This will enhance science literacy among all participants and may engage a few students in a new academic career. 

Implementing Interdisciplinary Experiential Learning at a Tribal College 

This two-year Capacity project will focus on building new collaborations with North Dakota State University. The project will investigate the potential of equine assisted learning as a means to address the community concerns about loss of culture and low academic achievement among reservation youth. 

Effectiveness of sub-irrigation in the Milk River floodplain, Montana 

This two-year, New Discovery project will investigate whether a sub-irrigation system can address the agricultural needs of in semi-arid regions of northcentral Montana. The Aaniiih Nakoda College community garden will serve as a demonstration plot for this new tool to manage soil moisture and nutrient management. The project director also hopes to attract more students to the environmental science program with the project. Montana State University-Bozeman will partner with the college on this research.

Strengthening Little Big Horn College Research Capacity through Improving Rural Families` Access to Safe Drinking Water 

This two-year, New Discovery project, a partnership with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, seeks to apply archeology to develop a more sustainable agriculture on the Menominee reservation. The project builds on three (3) tribal research capacity grants and will explore Menominee agricultural practices from 750 to 1650 AD to gain insights on systems that could benefit modern agriculture during times of climate change. Thirty students will benefit from this project, including ten student interns, qualifying it for the enhanced student funding option. 





Fiscal Year2016: For FY 2016:
Turtle Mountain Community College, Anishinabe Campus Student Research Experience. Using Biological Indicators as Measures for Water Quality

Turtle Mountain Community College students will use biological indicators to measure water quality in Belcourt Lake. This project builds off of previous student research projects, which also used macroinvertebrates to evaluate water quality in Ox Creek, a waterway fed by the spill way of Belcourt Lake. The previous project found high levels of lead in sloughs north and west of Belcourt Lake. The project director expects six students to have an intensive training in research and leadership skills. 

An Undergraduate Research Experience to Develop Improved Forest Carbon and Biomass Models for the Salish-Kootenai & Nez Perce Inventory Programs

The project supports sustainable silviculture of indigenous forests and bioenergy production. It will also train students through hands-on experiences in forestry research.  The collaborators are the University of Montana’s College of Forestry and Conservation, a McIntire-Stennis institution. Tribal partners are the forestry departments of the Nez Perce, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes.

Conservation Bison Herd Health and Well-Being

This research will evaluate the effect of diet, parasites and disease on the reproductive fitness of Fort Peck Tribe’s bison herds. The Fort Peck Tribe’s Yellowstone conservation herd had a calving rate of essentially 100 percent in 2015. However, in the same year, the tribe’s commercial herd’s calving rate was only 75 percent. This study whether herd health is the deciding factor in the calving rates.  The project director reports that the Fort Peck Tribes conservation herd offers a rare opportunity to conduct this evidence-based research, as its genetics are devoid of cattle DNA introgression. The work will be conducted with direct involvement of three Fort Peck Community College students supervised by faculty from that institution.

Plant Phenology as an Indicator of Forest Community Resilience and Adaptive Capacity

This research will evaluate how climate changes affects how plants emerge, flower, produce seed and go dormant. Observing changes in plant life cycles and their reproductive fitness could provide strong indicators of changing climate conditions and assist natural resource managers in responding to change. In particular, this project will identify which plant species can provide “early warning” indicators of climate change in Northeastern Wisconsin.

New Discovery: Atmospheric Mercury Loading In The St. Louis River Watershed And Potential Correlation With Dragonfly Bioaccumulation

The project director will guide students as they measure the mercury deposition in the St. Louis River watershed. Students will test for correlation between dry deposition and bioaccumulation of mercury in dragonfly larvae. The data will help tribal natural resource managers and health officials to protect those who rely on the watershed’s fish and plant life food. This student, which builds on previous student research, is also timely in that recent studies find that one in ten infants on the North Shore of Lake Superior have unsafe levels of mercury in their blood.

Fiscal Year2016: University of Hawaii (UH) Agribusiness Education, Training and Incubation (AETI) Project—

The purpose of this project is to:  
(1) develop and strengthen the local agricultural and food production workforce through education and training and 
(2) expand local agricultural and food production through more productive agribusinesses. 

This partnership of 8 UH campuses. the UH’s Agribusiness Incubator Program provides educational programs that target a variety of degree levels, including Associate of Science, and Bachelors of Science. Also, the program emphasizes Student Experiential Learning, and Student Recruitment, Retention, and Educational Equality, with focus on developing student leadership skills, and building capacity among Hawaii’s rural agriculture communities, including a large number of NH and other traditionally underserved minority populations. Project outcomes include a higher number of graduates in agricultural sciences; and increased productivity and profitability of Hawaii agribusinesses.
Drumbeats Alaska: Tradition and Science, Year 3

Tradition and Science, Year 3, has two main thrusts—plan for sustainability of indigenous knowledge and usage paired with Western science programs to strengthen career pathways for Alaska Native and rural students. “Subsistence knowledge and usage” is a term based on the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA) and used to refer to those target USDA sciences that assist individuals and communities to better understand and improve food, shelter, transportation and other material aspects of rural/village life. The proposed plan of work continues to build on the accomplishments of earlier funding to deliver coursework and support students in Ethnobotany, Environmental Studies (including sustainable energy), High Latitude Range Management and continued development of new opportunities in tribal natural resource management. Funding will also support the continued development of a coastal resource science program at UAS Ketchikan and a continued marine science career pathway at UAS Sitka.

The agency analyzes how demographic trends, employment opportunities, Federal policies, and public investment in infrastructure and technology enhance economic opportunity and quality of life for rural Americans.  Equally important is ERS’s commitment to help enhance the quality of life for the Nation’s small farmers who increasingly depend on these rural economies for employment and economic support, as well as to analyze new developments in the linkages between these farmers, consumers, and local economies.

ERS continues to monitor changing economic and demographic trends in rural America, particularly the implications of these changes for the employment, education, income, and housing patterns of low-income rural populations.  The rural development process is complex and sensitive to a wide range of factors that, to a large extent, are unique to each rural community.  Nonetheless, ERS assesses general approaches to development to determine when, where, and under what circumstances rural development strategies will be most successful.

ERS research and analysis provide insight into market conditions facing U.S. agriculture, avenues for innovation, and market expansion to help farmers and ranchers manage risk.  ERS produces USDA’s estimates of farm income.  In addition, the ERS program identifies and analyzes market structure and technological developments that affect efficiency and profitability.

The ERS climate change research program develops models and other analytical techniques to predict responses of farmers to greenhouse gas mitigation options, analyze the impact of mitigation options on domestic and global agricultural markets and land and water use, and evaluate adaptation by farmers to a new climate regime through use of alternative technologies.  The ERS climate change research program builds on extensive expertise on the economics of land use and land management, technology adoption, conservation program design, economics of biofuels, and value and dissemination of public investment in research and development.
In addition, ERS is continuing to contribute to USDA’s efforts to improve the science behind Federal environmental, water and air quality regulations and programs.  As part of its analysis of environmental regulations and conservation incentive policies, ERS research continues to provide insight into developing policies for controlling nonpoint source pollution.  More generally, ERS research analyzes the economic efficiency, environmental effectiveness, and distributional implications of alternative designs of resource, conservation, environmental, and commodity programs and their linkages.
ERS conducts research on technological innovation in agriculture, the economic performance, structure and viability of the farm sector and of different types of farms, and the state of global food security.  ERS effectively communicates research findings to policy makers, program managers, and those shaping the public debate.  The research program identifies key economic issues and uses sound analytical techniques to understand the immediate and broader economic and social consequences of alternative policies and programs related to the sustainability and use of biotechnology in U.S. agriculture, including policies to promote trade of U.S. products.  
ERS has a broad program of work examining the production and marketing characteristics of the U.S. organic sector.  Ongoing activities include research on the adoption of certified organic farming systems across the U.S., analysis of consumer demand and prices in specific markets, and several nationwide surveys of organic producers and markets.  
The ERS research program includes an ongoing assessment of global food security.  ERS provides research, analysis, and information on food security, including factors affecting food production and ability to import food, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Commonwealth of Independent States to decision makers in the United States and throughout the world.  An annual report provides an up-to-date assessment of global food security.

Fiscal Year2016: ERS will identify key economic issues related to rural economic development, farm viability, rural household prosperity and well-being, and competitiveness.  ERS will use sound analytical techniques to understand the immediate and broader economic and social consequences of how alternative policies and programs and changing market conditions affect rural and farm economies and households.  ERS will effectively communicate research results to policy makers, program managers, and those shaping the public debate on rural economic conditions and performance of all sizes and types of farms.

ERS will identify key economic issues related to interactions among natural resources, environmental quality, and the agriculture production system.  ERS also will use sound analytical techniques to understand the immediate and broader economic and social consequences of alternative policies and programs to protect and enhance environmental quality associated with agriculture.  ERS research analyzes the economic effects and cost effectiveness of resource, conservation, environmental, and commodity programs and their linkages.  Topics include USDA's conservation programs and environmental policies addressing water and air quality and climate change associated with agricultural production.  ERS will effectively communicate research results to policy makers, program managers, and those shaping public debate on agricultural resource use and environmental quality.  
ERS will identify key economic issues related to the competitiveness and sustainability of rural and farm economies, including economic factors guiding the development and adoption of new technologies and production systems to support food security and trade.  These activities include the following:

• ERS supports the USDA Biotechnology Coordinating Council and interdepartmental efforts with the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency through research that addresses impacts for farmer and industry behavior.  Research and related data collection efforts are designed to capture the broad effects of this technology.  
• ERS provides important information on changes in production technology of food production and adoption of new agricultural inputs and practices that have significant implications for the way in which the Nation’s food supply is produced.  
• ERS develops and disseminates research and analysis on the U.S. food and agriculture sector’s performance in the context of increasingly globalized markets.  Key emphasis areas include regional free trade agreements, domestic policy reforms, and the principal drivers of structural changes in global supply and demand.  
• ERS produces an annual assessment of the prevalence and depth of food security in 76 developing and transition countries.  ERS will expand public access to the data and model used to conduct this analysis by making the full database and several country models available on its website.  In addition, ERS is developing new model capabilities, including the ability to assess the impact of changes in food prices, which will make the model capable of addressing all four dimensions of food security—availability, access, utilization and stability.

Fiscal Year2018: ERS will conduct the following research on the rural and farm economy: 

Large-Scale Farms in the United States.  Farm production continues to shift to larger operations.  ERS will analyze this shift for different regions and commodities, and will assess reasons for its continuation.  The study will also focus on the attributes of very large U.S. farms using a new top sales class of $10 million or more.  ERS will examine size and growth, management, ownership, commodity focus, and financial performance of the largest farms.  

Implications of Changing Land Values for Financial Stress and Land Ownership.  ERS research will examine the potential vulnerability of the farm sector to changes in agricultural land values, interest rates, and commodity prices.  Farm real estate values reached record highs in 2013, but forecasts indicate a slowing rate of appreciation, or possibly even a decline in land values caused in part by lower commodity prices and rising interest rates.
 
Financial Stress, Bankruptcies, and Loan Delinquencies.  After several years of strong growth in farm income, the sector’s overall returns have declined, with net farm income now forecast for 2016 to be 45 percent below the $123.8 billion peak in 2013.  The decline may lead to increased financial stress within the sector; two possible indicators of financial stress would be increases in farm bankruptcies and in loan delinquencies.  ERS is analyzing trends in bankruptcies and loan delinquencies over time in order to understand and identify drivers of financial stress in the sector.  Preliminary results using the most recent available data indicate minimal signs of financial stress in the agricultural sector.  Both farm bankruptcy rates, considered a lagging indicator of financial stress, and commercial bank delinquency rates for agricultural loans, are low compared to historical levels and to more recent history in the 2000s. 

Trends in Mortality Rates among Rural Residents.  Preliminary ERS research has identified rising mortality rates among some subgroups in the rural U.S. population during the twenty-first century.  This analysis focuses on the largest such group, middle-aged white men, tracing the upward trend in death rates since 2000 and examining possible correlates of this trend, including access to health care and increasing economic distress in some rural regions.

Analysis of the Rural Rental Housing Program.  ERS research will examine the current allocation of USDA’s housing and the communities served, areas presently underserved or at risk of becoming underserved, the factors contributing to the risk of loss of affordable rental housing, and the communities and populations likely to be affected.  Since 1963, USDA has made subsidized direct loans to developers to finance affordable, multi-family rental housing in rural areas for low and moderate income families, elderly people, and persons with disabilities.  This research will inform policy makers concerned about the need for affordable rental housing in rural areas.

ERS will conduct the following research on farm and commodity policy: 

Analysis of USDA Risk Management Programs.  American farmers face risks from weather and markets for the inputs they purchase (e.g., energy, labor) and products they sell. ERS will continue to provide research that analyzes the environment in which farmers operate and USDA’s risk management programs.  Building on a set of ERS studies completed or to be completed in FY17 on risk management policies and programs under the 2014 Farm Bill programs, ERS will conduct analysis that could have implements for program design.  One study will provide a broad overview of the different risk management tools available in different countries, which in turn will inform an empirical analysis for domestic producers of how changes to their agricultural risk management portfolio impacts their downside revenue risk.  Motivated by the notion that weather data is rapidly collected for all counties, another study will empirically examine for U.S. crop producers the differences in impacts on risk management of crop insurance policies and other commodity support policies using a weather-based yield index rather than farm yield-based.   

Improved Season-Average Price Forecasts.  ERS will conduct research on using forward-looking data and methods to improve the accuracy and expand market information provided from USDA’s situation and outlook program. The analysis will use public USDA reports and daily futures and options prices to better inform market participants about price uncertainty in major agricultural commodity markets. Ultimately, derivatives markets are a technology that improves the discovery of market price levels given supply and demand fundaments.  To the degree that the latter are well understood, markets function more efficiently.
  
Feed Grains Database Developments.  The ERS Feed Grains Database is an important component in USDA monitoring of the grain, oilseed, and livestock complex, providing data on four feed grains (corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats), seven foreign coarse grains (feed grains plus rye, millet, and mixed grains), hay, animal unit indexes of grain and roughage, rail rate indexes, and grain shipments.  The database serves as an important, timely, accurate, reliable, and official source of information for stakeholders.  Planned program enhancements include applications to enhance the delivery of information and expansion to other commodities.

Updated Commodity Cost and Returns Estimates.  ERS produces annual cost and returns estimates for nine crop commodities, as well as hogs and milk. The annual estimates update baseline estimates with information on changes in input and commodity prices, while the baselines are set using data on technologies, production processes, and expense shares from commodity-specific questionnaires of the ARMS. ERS will set new baselines for corn and milk with surveys from the 2016 ARMS, and will design a wheat questionnaire for the 2017 ARMS to help set a new wheat baseline estimate (the surveys are completed by spring of the year following the reference year).

Analysis of the Dairy Margin Protection Program.  ERS will conduct an ex-post examination of the Dairy Margin Protection Program, which offers dairy producers catastrophic coverage at no cost. The analysis will use the USDA baseline to examine margin expectations and milk output and how margins are likely to increase in nominal terms by the next Farm Bill. This research will further explain how feed efficiency and milk output could impact the national averages calculated for the program.

U.S. Hog Production: Continuing Trends in Productivity Growth.  Total factor productivity in the U.S. hog industry will be estimated using Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data to determine productivity trends. Information pertaining to changes in industry structure and production practices including changes in the size of operations, the use of production contracts, growth-promoting antibiotics, and innovative technologies are reported and evaluated relative to productivity growth.

ERS will conduct the following activities related to homeland security:

Analysis of Animal Disease Outbreaks.  ERS researchers will collaborate with Federal and academic researchers to examine how economic variables and factors affect animal and crop disease outbreak assessments.  This work will examine how economic analysis can help to develop clearer views of actual and hypothetical outbreaks, and to more fully identify what factors are significant in measuring the success of a mitigation or prevention effort.  This research focuses on efforts to introduce economic components into epidemiological analysis that will allow analysts and decision makers to include social (e.g., impacts on rural communities) considerations and expand the number of criteria that may be used to determine effective outbreak responses.  ERS will continue to invest in the data and analytical capacity needed to provide the current market context and data needed to support USDA Homeland Security event assessments and planning efforts, and support the USDA Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza multiagency coordination. In addition, ERS is contributing expertise as subject matter experts to the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, for the Agro-terrorism Risk Assessment, and the NSTC Foreign Animal Disease Threats Interagency Working Group.  

ERS will conduct the following research on conservation, water, and environmental issues:

Conservation Compliance.  To maintain eligibility for most agriculture-related federal programs, Conservation Compliance requires farmers to implement approved conservation systems on highly erodible cropland and refrain from draining wetlands.  The Agricultural Act of 2014 eliminated Direct Payments and Countercyclical 
Payments —which previously accounted for a large proportion of compliance incentives—but also created “shallow loss” programs and linked crop insurance premium subsidies to Conservation Compliance requirements.  ERS research will investigate the effectiveness of conservation compliance, changes in incentives due to the Agricultural Act of 2014, and the effectiveness of these incentives in protecting highly erodible cropland and wetlands.  

Economics of Reducing Nutrient Losses from Agriculture in the Mississippi Atchafalaya River Basin.  ERS research will examine the economic consequences of reducing nutrient losses from agriculture to the Gulf of Mexico and its implications for improving environmental quality.  Every summer a large hypoxic zone forms in the Gulf of Mexico.  Low dissolved oxygen in the Gulf is a serious environmental concern that can impact valuable fisheries and disrupt sensitive ecosystems.  Reducing agricultural nutrient losses has been a major conservation goal for USDA and many Mississippi Basin states.  However, despite years of investment in conservation measures, most cropland does not meet criteria for good nutrient management.  ERS expects to publish a report that examines policy options for reducing nutrient losses in the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River Basin.

Changes in Climate and Crop Insurance.  The changing climate has the potential to introduce greater uncertainty into agricultural production, with implications for farm profitability.  This can influence the demand for crop insurance products and the costs to government of providing crop insurance premium subsidies.  ERS researchers are examining how a changing climate will affect crop insurance premium subsidies in 2080.  The ERS analysis combines models of crop risk, land allocation, prices, and crop insurance premiums to simulate total premium subsidy costs under alternative scenarios.  

Determinants of Unfinished Conservation Practices.  Since 1996, USDA working lands programs have entered into hundreds of thousands of conservation contracts.  Many of the practices specified in these contracts are never installed as planned, leading to lost opportunities for additional conservation activity.  ERS researchers are examining reasons why practices get dropped, using EQIP program administrative data to ascertain whether changes to conservation plans are due solely to adaptive management (adjusting to unforeseen weather or financial conditions) or to other reasons related to contract design.  

Conservation “Legacy” Effects.  An aspect of conservation policy that has received little attention is how financial assistance may provide conservation benefits beyond the specific location and duration of program participation. ERS researchers are using EQIP administrative data along with satellite data to study the extent to which participation leads farmers to retain conservation tillage practices after the contract has expired or to adopt conservation tillage on non-contract fields, or the extent to which participation leads neighboring farmers to adopt conservation tillage on their land.  This research improves our understanding of the long-term benefits from conservation, and would help in the development of better metrics for measuring program success.  

Herbicide Resistant Weed Management in Corn. Weed resistance to the herbicide glyphosate (popularly known as Round-up) is a growing problem in field crops, and there are also emerging concerns with insect resistance to seeds genetically engineered with the Bt toxin.  ERS has elicited information on pesticide use, seed choices, and resistance management practices from farmers in the 2016 Corn Production Practices questionnaire of the ARMS.  ERS research will evaluate farm strategies to manage weed and insect resistance, and track how those strategies have changed since the earlier 2010 ARMS corn survey; the research will also draw on related ARMS soybean surveys for 2006 and 2012.

ERS will conduct the following research on global agricultural markets and food security:

Investments in Agricultural Research in High-Income Countries.  There is a growing concern that agricultural productivity growth, especially in high-income countries, may be slowing, and that current agricultural R&D levels may not be sufficient to address this concern. Some Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries have introduced policy reforms to improve the financing and performance of their public agricultural R&D systems. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and comparable information on these trends and developments, particularly for countries outside of the U.S.  ERS is analyzing trends in U.S. agricultural research funding and agricultural research policy reforms in the context of global changes.  This analysis will demonstrate the impact of R&D investments on agricultural productivity growth and examine the complementary roles of public and private research, and relate public investments to the size of the agricultural sector and to public science investments across the economy. 

The Next Horizon: The Agricultural Trade Policy Landscape in 2016 and Beyond.  ERS will quantify the potential for gains from trade reform under existing forms of polices targeted at agriculture.  The core of the product would be an estimate of economic impacts of selected current domestic and border intervention policies, focusing on tariffs and tariff-rate quotas and other trade-related policies, domestic support, and non-tariff measures.  To examine the impacts of different policy scenarios, the trade modeling framework will remove these policies separately and in combination in the context of multilateral trade liberalization.

Global Price Determination. While price in a given region reflects local (current and expected) supply and demand fundamentals, important agricultural commodities are often traded internationally, meaning that regional prices are also affected by the prices—and therefore the fundamentals—of their trading partners.  ERS research will examine whether shifting production and trading patterns for several major commodities have affected the degree to which U.S. prices inform global prices, and also the influence international production and demand shocks have over prices paid to farmers domestically.

China’s Commodity Markets and Efficiency.  China has become more integrated with global agricultural markets since its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.  China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of most agricultural commodities, so its integration with global markets is an important determinant of the efficiency of those markets.  ERS research will evaluate the efficiency of agricultural commodity markets before and after China’s WTO accession to characterize the country’s degree of global integration.

International Food Security Assessment.  ERS produces an annual assessment of the prevalence and depth of food security in low-and middle-income countries.  ERS makes available the full historical database used for the model projections on its website.  ERS developed new model capabilities, included in the 2017 report, including the ability to assess the impact of changes in food prices and income on demand.  This allows ERS analysis to address all four dimensions of food security—availability, access, utilization and stability.  

Progress and Challenges in Global Food Security. ERS will analyze progress made in reducing global food security, as well as new areas of challenge, drawing on 25 years of data from the International Food Security database.  The analysis will examine progress in food security measurement, agricultural trade and food security, agricultural productivity and food safety nets.  It will also highlight emerging issues that create new food security challenges, such as nutrition, risk management, climate change and urbanization.  It integrates the analysis with priorities developed in the Global Food Security Act of 2016.  

ERS will conduct the following research on production technologies:
	
Developments in Markets for U.S. Organic Exports.  ERS research will examine developments in the U.S. organic export market.  In addition to developing absolute and relative measures of organic trade performance over time, by commodity, and by trading partner, ERS will analyze the impact of equivalency agreements on observed trade flows.  Results will inform the extent to which observed increases in U.S. organic exports can be attributed to these agreements as compared to changes in market fundamentals.

Evolution of Markets for Genetically Engineered Seeds.  Since their commercial introduction in 1996, most acreage planted to genetically engineered (GE) seeds have been planted to three crops—corn, cotton, and soybeans—and has featured two traits, one for insect resistance and one for herbicide tolerance.  In recent years, GE acreage has expanded to other field crops, such as alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets, and seed developers have added more complex combinations of the two key traits as well as new traits for drought tolerance.  ERS research will draw on questions introduced into the 2016 ARMS to track the spread of new types of GE technologies.

However, these differences in transportation mode do not translate into differences in the types of stores used for grocery shopping among SNAP households.  The National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) is the first survey to collect unique and comprehensive data about food purchases and acquisitions for a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.  In March 2015, ERS published a report that compared shopping patterns of SNAP households to low- and higher income nonparticipant households and found that many households bypass the store that is closest to them to shop at another store.  For example, among SNAP households, the nearest store was, on average, 2.0 miles from the household, but the store primarily used for grocery shopping was, on average, 3.4 miles from the household.  Multiple intramural and extramural research projects are underway using FoodAPS with reports focusing on general food expenditures and WIC participant shopping behavior planned for release in 2016.\r\n\r\n•\tAn estimated 86 percent of American households were food secure throughout the entire year in 2014, meaning that they had access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members.  The remaining households (14 percent) were food insecure at least some time during the year, including 5.6 percent with very low food security because the household lacked money and other resources for food, resulting in reduced food intake and disruptions in eating patterns for one or more household members.  Additional research focused specifically on children shows that an estimated 90.6 percent of households with children were food secure throughout the year in 2011, which denotes that all  household members had consistent access to adequate food for active, healthy lives.  The ERS food security statistics are widely recognized as the benchmark for measuring food security in the U.S., and support decision making on USDA food assistance and nutrition programs.\r\n\r\n•\tFollowing Dietary Guidance need not cost more, but many Americans would need to re-allocate their food budgets to do so.  Behavioral changes can improve diet quality, but major improvements would require Americans to change how they allocate their food budgets across food groups.  Most Americans across all income levels consume poor diets. Behavior changes, such as preparing food at home instead of eating out, are associated with improvements in diet quality.  To realize the much larger improvements in diet quality required to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ERS research found that many Americans would need to reallocate their food budgets, spending a larger share on fruits and vegetables and a lower share on protein foods and foods high in solid fats, added sugars, and sodium.  Briefings on this topic to senior USDA and other policy officials informed discussions of the upcoming release of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines.\r\n\r\n•\tAn estimated 1,249 calories per capita per day are lost from the food supply.  ERS published the latest estimates on the amount and value of food loss in the United States.  These estimates are for more than 200 individual foods using ERS’s Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data.  In 2010, an estimated 31 percent, or 133 billion pounds, of the 430 billion pounds of food produced was not available for human consumption at the retail and consumer levels.  This amount of loss totaled an estimated $161.6 billion, as purchased at retail prices.  For the first time, ERS estimates of the calories associated with food loss are presented in this report.  The top three food groups in terms of the share of the total value of food loss at the retail and consumer levels are meat, poultry, and fish (30 percent), vegetables (19 percent), and dairy products (17 percent).  Food loss data from ERS is used to support USDA’s Food Waste Challenge initiative and also provides a model for other countries’ efforts to estimate food loss.\r\n\r\n•\tHouseholds living in low-income, low food-access areas have only slightly lower diet quality than other households and this difference is partially alleviated when these consumers travel farther from their homes to purchase food.  About 10 percent of the U.S. population lives in low-income areas more than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket.  The diet quality of these consumers may be compromised by their food environment. Some may be unable to reach supermarkets regularly or without effort, instead buying food from closer stores that offer less healthy food products.  ERS investigated the correlation between households that live in low-income, low-access areas and their purchases of 14 major food groups that vary in dietary quality using supermarket scanner data.  Briefings on this topic to senior USDA and other policy officials informed discussions of continuing efforts to improve food access for low-income households across the U.S.\r\n\r\nERS research on USDA’s food and nutrition assistance programs found the following:\r\n•\tERS linked 2008-12 SNAP administrative records to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) on the use of SNAP and other public assistance programs to provide better information on SNAP receipt than that which would be estimated by the ACS alone.  SNAP provides food and nutrition benefits to low-income households based on a formula that adjusts the benefit amount a household receives based on monthly need.  ERS assessed the extent to which SNAP reaches the poorest households, also known as benefit targeting, by estimating benefit receipt by annual household income relative to poverty.  Estimates of SNAP targeting toward low-income households improve when using either of two measures of intensity of SNAP participation relative to measures of ever-in-the-year participation.  Replacing survey-based data on SNAP benefit receipt with administrative records of SNAP benefit receipt and adjusting the survey households to more closely reflect administrative SNAP units also improves estimates of targeting to low-income participants.  Briefings to senior official at FNCS and FNS informed decision makers about the effect of more expansive data on participation measures.\r\n\r\n•\tSchool meal programs are adjusting to stronger nutritional standards, but face challenges in maintaining paid lunch participation to meet revenue goals.  School foodservice programs face ongoing tradeoffs between meal cost, student participation, and nutrition quality.  Changes mandated by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 strengthened nutritional standards for meals and competitive foods and set minimum levels for paid meal revenues, while new options allow more schools to offer free meals to all students at reduced administrative burden.  An ERS review of recent research results and new data on school lunch participation rates suggests that while many school districts have adjusted to new standards, maintaining paid meal participation remains most challenging for smaller and more rural districts.  Briefings to senior USDA officials on this topic have informed USDA efforts to help States meet the challenges related to improving nutrition within allotted budgets.\r\n\r\nERS research on the safety of the nation’s food supply found the following:\r\n•\tCost estimates of foodborne illnesses data provide Federal agencies with consistent, peer-reviewed estimates of the costs of foodborne illness that can be used in analyzing the impact of Federal regulations.  ERS’s Cost of Foodborne Illness data product, produced in collaboration with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, provides detailed data about the costs of major foodborne illnesses in the United States, including identification of specific disease outcomes for foodborne infections caused by 15 major pathogens in the United States, associated outpatient and inpatient expenditures on medical care, associated lost wages, and estimates of individuals’ willingness to pay to reduce mortality resulting from these foodborne illnesses.  It also provides stakeholders and the general public with a means of understanding the relative impact of different foodborne infections in the United States.  Cost estimates of foodborne illnesses have been used to help inform food-safety policy discussions, and these updated cost estimates provide a foundation for economic analysis of food safety policy.\r\n\r\n•\tNew surveys on food safety practices.  ERS launched an initiative to collect primary data on current food safety practices for produce growers and post-harvest firms to provide a baseline of compliance costs prior to the full implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).  The surveys will be completed by NASS in January 2016, and ERS will use the data in estimating the potential economic impacts of FSMA provisions on the fresh produce and animal feed sectors. \r\n\r\n•\tConsumers respond differently to foodborne disease outbreaks of different severities.  A case study of pathogen-related recalls of cantaloupe in 2011 and 2012 suggests consumers’ food purchase responses take into account the relative risk severity of specific pathogens. Information from news media apparently plays a role.  Federal health and safety officials warned consumers away from cantaloupes in 2011 and again in 2012.  The warnings occurred under similar market conditions but were for contamination by two different foodborne microorganisms that posed entirely different health risks.  After consumers were informed about the risk with the higher fatality rate, the demand for cantaloupes fell and consumers substituted other melons.  No such shifts in demand were evident under the lower fatality risk, despite more illnesses attributed to it.\r\n\r\n•\tEstablishments that bid on contracts to supply the USDA’s National School Lunch Program had relatively higher levels of food safety, as measured by fewer samples of meat testing positive for Salmonella, than other establishments supplying ground beef to the commercial market.  In December of 2014, ERS published a report that examined the food safety performance of suppliers of ground beef to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and found evidence of strategic behavior in which managers use information about their establishment’s past food safety performance to decide whether to bid on contracts to supply the NSLP.  Research results from this report were presented at multiple briefings to senior USDA officials.\r\n""},{""fiscalYear"":2017,""description"":""ERS studies the relationship among the many factors that influence food choices and health outcomes.  At the household level, research focuses on food price trends, income, and individual characteristics such as age, race and ethnicity, household structure, knowledge of diet and health, and nutrition education.  At the industry level, research focuses on the interaction among firms, consumers, and government programs and policies.  Children’s food access, food security, and child and adult obesity continue to be important foci of the ERS research program.  ERS research related to adult and child obesity includes approaches taken from behavioral economics to investigate how psychological mechanisms related to food choices might contribute to poor dietary quality and obesity.  \r\n\r\nThrough its food assistance and nutrition research and by working closely with USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, ERS studies and analyzes the Nation’s nutrition assistance programs.  These programs receive substantial Federal funding and affect the daily lives of millions of America’s children.  Long-term research themes include dietary and nutritional outcomes, food program targeting and delivery, and measurement of program participation.  ERS research is designed to meet the critical information needs of USDA, Congress, program managers, policy officials, the research community, and the public at large.  \r\n\r\nERS food safety research focuses on enhancing methodologies for valuing societal benefits associated with reducing food safety risks, understanding consumer response to food safety incidents, assessing industry incentives to enhance food safety through new technologies and supply chain linkages, and evaluating regulatory options and change.  ERS research also investigates the safety of food imports and the efficacy of international food safety policies and practices. \r\n""}],""isApplicable"":true}",Not Applicable.,"{""flag"":""none""}","Nancy A.

Food Insecurity in Veteran Households.  Food insecurity as a measure of well-being for veterans and their households is relatively unstudied.  Previous studies have been restricted to non-nationally representative samples or focused on veterans with disabilities.  This study uses a nationally representative sample of veterans to describe the prevalence of food insecurity among veterans, subpopulations of veterans, and veteran households by selected characteristics.  

Using Administrative Data to Improve Research on the Causal Effects of the SNAP Program on Labor Supply. This project continues the work on the effects of food assistance program participation on individuals’ incentives to work. Previous work examined the issue using Current Population Survey (CPS) data from Census that contain labor supply information as well as information on whether the individual participated in the SNAP program.  Misreporting of SNAP participation in CPS data is a major issue with uncertain effects on estimates of the effect of participation on outcomes.  The goal of the project will be to link administrative data sources to CPS data, examine how estimates of causal effects of SNAP participation on labor supply are affected by SNAP misreporting, and examine possible solutions to bias created by misreporting.  

The Food Assistance National Input-Output Multiplier (FANIOM) Model and Stimulus Effects of SNAP.  This project will examine the role of SNAP as a stimulus measure during an economic downturn.  Using the Food Assistance National Input-Output Multiplier (FANIOM) model, we estimate the multiplier effect of a hypothetical SNAP expansion on economic output and employment.  Since the end of the Great Recession, new research and new data sources are available to inform on this topic.  Borrowing on these new sources, this project extends the work of ERS researchers in 2012 to provide an updated estimate of the multiplier effect of the SNAP program on the economy.  Additionally, we review new literature examining the impact of the SNAP program on the economy during the Great Recession. 

The Role of SNAP in the Rural Economy.  ERS research will compare the rural impacts of the Supplemental Food Assistance Program (SNAP) to those in urban areas and to impacts of other Federal programs targeted to rural areas, such as agricultural commodity and rural development programs.  Although SNAP is the largest USDA program, little research has investigated the economic effects of SNAP in rural areas.  The project will examine how SNAP affects household savings and consumption decisions, impacts of SNAP on employment in rural vs. urban communities, and impacts of SNAP compared to impacts of agricultural commodity programs nationally and in selected regions.  

Characteristics of School Districts Offering Free School Meals to All Students Throught the Community Eligiblity Provision.  This project will study the determinants of school and district participation in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP).  In 2010, Congress mandated the CEP as a reimbursement option that allows schools serving high percentages of low-income students to offer USDA school meals at no charge to all students with reduced administrative burden.  USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service expects the CEP to result in expanded participation with most impact on poor or near-poor students who may benefit the most from USDA’s child nutrition programs.  

Food Costs of Large School Food Authorities in the National School Lunch Program.  The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) reimburses school food authorities (SFAs) for the estimated costs of providing school lunches and breakfasts.  Reimbursement rates are based on cost accounting techniques that measure SFA labor, food purchase, and operating material costs.  All SFAs in the 48 contiguous states receive the same reimbursement rates regardless of size or geographic location.  Thus FNS implicitly assumes that labor and food purchase costs are the same across SFAs.  Recent research shows that economies of scale exist in meal service and food costs vary across SFAs.  Yet SFAs vary in size from large, urban SFAs serving millions of meals per year to small, rural and suburban SFAs serving less than 10,000 meals.  This research will determine if cost differences exist in food purchases and if so, how these differences in costs shape food choices.

WIC and the Retail Markup of Infant Formula.  This project will examine the retail markup of the formula purchased through WIC.  The number of participants in WIC who can be served within the fixed budget depends heavily on the program’s food-package costs, which in turn are significantly affected by the cost of infant formula. Do retailers charge higher markups for the WIC contract brand than for the non-WIC brands of formula?  This is an important question because retail markups, along with the net prices, are what WIC—and ultimately U.S. taxpayers—pay for infant formula.  The answer to this question may also have implications for the prices that non-WIC participants pay for infant formula.    

ERS will conduct the following research on food safety, foodborne illness, and industry practices:

Estimating Food Attributable Fractions of Foodborne Illness from Time Series Data.  Reliable measures of the relative role of different foods in foodborne illness caused by specific pathogens are critical to government’s and industry’s ability to target food safety interventions effectively.  USDA, FDA and CDC have all identified a need for new, more reliable methods to estimate this relationship.  This collaborative study between ERS, CDC and the University of California, Berkeley pioneers use of Nielsen HomeScan time series data on food consumption and FoodNet foodborne illness surveillance to estimate the relative contributions of specific foods to illnesses caused by major foodborne pathogens.  

Trends in Food Product Recalls: 2004-2013.  Food product recalls, the removal of risky food products from the marketplace, can impose significant burdens for consumers, producers, and regulators.  This report analyzes trends and patterns of food product recall events from 2004 to 2013.  The analysis considers multiple factors, including the types of foods being recalled, the reasons for initiating the recalls, the severity of the risks posed by the recalled products, and the geographic distribution. 

The 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and the Fresh Produce Industry.  Using new survey data collected through a joint ERS/NASS initiative, ERS researchers will assess pre-implementation food safety practices relative to several FSMA rules specifically focused on fresh produce. Results will compare food safety practices and costs of adoption for different size farms or post-harvest operations, for different regions of the country, and to the extent possible for different produce commodities.  The research will provide a baseline for eventual assessment of effectiveness of FSMA adoption.Fiscal Year2016: ERS will identify key economic issues affecting food prices, food access and availability, food consumption patterns, and food safety.  ERS will use sound analytical techniques to understand the immediate and long-term efficiency, efficacy, and equity consequences of alternative policies and programs aimed at ensuring access by children and adults to safe, nutritious, affordable, and adequate meals.  ERS ongoing research will also explore factors that can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of USDA Food and Nutrition Assistance programs.  ERS will effectively communicate research results to policy makers, program managers, and those shaping efforts to promote abundant, safe, and healthful food at home and abroad.  Examples of these activities include the following:

• Providing economic analysis of the food marketing system to understand factors affecting the availability and affordability of food for American consumers.  
• Providing annual estimates of the quantity of food available for human consumption, and measures of disappearance and loss in the food system.
• Providing economic analysis of how people make food choices, including demands for more healthful, nutritious, and safer food, and of the determinants of those choices, including prices, income, education, and socio-economic characteristics.
• Conducting analyses of the benefits and costs of policies to change behavior to improve diet and health, including nutrition education, labeling, advertising, and regulation.
• Conducting economic analyses of the impacts of the Nation’s domestic nutrition assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; and the Child Nutrition Programs.
• Conducting research on food program targeting and delivery to gauge the success of programs aimed at needy and at-risk population groups, and to identify program gaps and overlaps.
• Conducting research on program dynamics and administration, focusing on how program needs change with local labor market conditions, economic growth and recession, and how changing State welfare programs interact with food and nutrition programs.
• Conducting food safety economics research, with the goal of providing a science-based approach to valuing food safety risk reduction, assessing industry costs of food safety practices, and understanding the interrelated roles of government policy and market incentives in enhancing food safety.
• Providing decision makers and the public with food safety information through publications, web materials, and briefings that address the economics of food safety, including consumer knowledge and behavior, industry practices, the relationship between international trade and food safety, and government policies and regulations.
• Working with Federal food safety agency partners to evaluate available food borne illness data related to meat, poultry and egg products, and to develop more accurate measures of the effectiveness of regulatory strategies in reducing preventable food borne illness.
• Building food-price and food-consumption databases to provide a basis for analyzing the impacts of food policy.

NIFA Integrated Programs provide support for integrated research, education, and extension activities. Integrated, multi-functional projects are particularly effective in addressing important agricultural issues through the conduct of problem-focused research that is combined with education and extension of knowledge to those in need of solutions. These activities address critical national, regional, and multi-state agricultural issues, priorities, or problems. Integrated Programs hold the greatest potential to produce and disseminate knowledge and technology directly to end users while providing for educational opportunities to assure agricultural expertise in future generations. See individual program Requests for Applications for additional information about the topics.

SEVERAL PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED UNDER CFDA 10.303. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

(1)  Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program: National Integrated Water Quality Program
The goal of the National Integrated Water Quality Program is to improve the quality of our Nation's surface water and groundwater resources through research, education, and extension activities. Projects funded through this program will facilitate achieving this goal by advancing and disseminating the knowledge base available to agricultural and rural communities. Funded projects should lead to science-based decision-making and management practices that improve the quality of the Nation's surface water and groundwater resources in agricultural and rural watersheds. See RFA for priority areas.

(2)  Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program: National Integrated Food Safety Initiative
The purpose of the National Integrated Food Safety Initiative is to support food safety projects that demonstrate an integrated approach to solving problems in applied food safety research, education, or extension. Various models for integration of applied research, education, and extension will be considered for funding. Applications describing multi-state, multi-institutional, multidisciplinary, and multifunctional activities (and combinations thereof) are encouraged. Applicants are strongly encouraged to address at least two of the three functional areas of research, education, and extension (i.e., research and extension, research and education, or extension and education).

(3)  Integrated Research, Education, And Extension Competitive Grants Program: Regional Integrated Pest Management Centers
The goal of the Regional Integrated Pest Management Centers (IPM Centers) is to promote the development and implementation of IPM by facilitating collaboration across states, disciplines, and purposes. IPM Centers will establish and maintain information networks, build partnerships to address pest management challenges and opportunities, evaluate the impact of IPM implementation, communicate positive outcomes to key stakeholders, and manage funding resources effectively. Successful applicants to this program will demonstrate the capacity and commitment necessary to advance the goals of the National Roadmap for Integrated Pest Management (www.ipmcenters.org/IPMRoadMap.pdf), and evaluate the progress of this advancement. The IPM Roadmap addresses pest management needs for production agriculture, natural resources and recreational environments, and residential and public areas.

(4)  Integrated Pest Management: Crops at Risk Program
The goal of the CAR program is to enhance the development and implementation of innovative, ecologically based sustainable IPM system(s). Preferably, this should involve a diversity of tactics and approaches for a single or specific food or fiber commodity in commercial production for pre- and/or post-harvest system(s). The program addresses either a major acreage or high value crop commodity such as key fruits and vegetables. The primary emphasis is on crop productivity and profitability, while addressing critical environmental quality and human health issues. The CAR program will fund integrated multifunctional/multidisciplinary research, education, and extension projects for crops with high priority IPM needs as identified by stakeholders.

(5)  Integrated Pest Management: Risk Avoidance and Mitigation Program
The goal of the Risk Avoidance and Mitigation (RAMP) program is to enhance the development and implementation of innovative, ecologically based sustainable IPM strategies and system(s) for (a) multi-crop food and fiber production systems; (b) an area-wide or a landscape scale agroecosystem; or (c) a documented pesticide impact on water, human or environmental health. RAMP applications may address major acreage agricultural production systems, high value crops such as key fruit and vegetable systems, or other agroecosystems. The primary emphasis of the application should be on productivity and profitability while addressing critical environmental quality and human health issues. The intent of RAMP is to fund medium-term projects that emphasize systems approaches.

(6)  Integrated Research, Education, and Extension Competitive Grants Program: Integrated Pest Management: Methyl Bromide Transitions Program
The goal of the Methyl Bromide Transitions (MBT) program is to support the discovery and implementation of practical pest management alternatives to methyl bromide uses or minimize methyl bromide emissions for which the United States is requesting critical use exemptions. The program is focused on integrated commercial or field scale research that targets short- to medium-term solutions.

(7)  Integrated Organic Program
The purpose of the Integrated Organic Program is to solve critical organic agriculture issues, priorities, or problems through the integration of research, education, and extension activities. The Organic Transitions Program (ORG) funds the development and implementation of research, extension, and higher education programs to improve the competitiveness of organic producers and producers who are adopting organic practices. Funding opportunities for the ORG Program is included in the same Request for Applications (RFA) as the Organic Research and Extension Initiative (OREI).

PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT FUND START UP BUSINESSES.


(8)  Regional Rural Development Centers (RRDCs):
The RRDCs play a unique role in USDA's service to rural America.  They link the research and educational outreach capacity of the nation's public universities with communities, local decision makers, entrepreneurs, families, and farmers and ranchers to help address a wide range of development issues.  They collaborate on national issues that span regions-like e-commerce, the changing interface between rural, suburban, and urban places, and workforce quality and jobs creation. Each tailors programs to address particular needs in its region.

(G) Organic Transition-Risk Assessment
aka Organic Transition Program (ORG) FDC ""51106""

NOTE: Also see CFDA 10.307 OREI - FDC ""51300""

For Fiscal Year (FY) 2016:

2016-06198: Going underground:  Digging up the dirt on Metarhizium-plant-pest interactions in an organic cropping system. This study investigates the effects of cover crops and soil characteristics on the novel interactions among the fungus, Metarhizium, an endemic insect pathogen and plant-protective endophyte with crops and cover crops in an organic agronomic cropping system. Objectives include: 1) characterize Metarhizium isolates from on-going organic research-station and on-farm experiments; 2) determine the ability of endemic isolates to form endophytic relationships with cash crops and selected cover crops; 3) determine effects of endophytic Metarhizium in a model system of corn, black cutworm; and Cochliobolus heterostrophus, the causal agent of southern corn leaf blight; and 4) determine the effect of endophytic Metarhizium on the expression of key defense genes that protect plants from crop pests and diseases.

2016-06180: Decision Support to Quantify GHG Mitigation and Ecosystem Services from Organic Production Systems. This project will address ORG Program Priority by improving technologies and tools to document and optimize the environmental services and climate change mitigation ability of organic farming systems. The team will improve two state-of-the-art decision support systems (COMET-Farm and the Cool Farm Tool) for quantifying the impacts of land use and management practices on soil C and greenhouse gas –GHG- emissions from agricultural systems at the farm-scale. These improved decision support systems will enable the industry to deliver improved storytelling about organic beyond the label and help to identify opportunity areas for working with farmers to improve both productivity and profitability as well as deliver on corporate commitments to meet GHG reduction goals. 

2016-06197: Ensuring the best practical use of microbe-containing crop biostimulants/biofertilizers among (transitional)-organic vegetable growers. The long-term goal of this project is to create resources, tangible and human, ensuring the best practical use of Microbe-containing biostimulants and biofertilizers (MC BSs/BFs) among (transitional)-organic vegetable growers. The team  will: a) complete stakeholder-focused experiments on farms and research stations, b) expand and strengthen a growing network of farmers and other professionals while evaluating and reporting on product performance, and c) establish, share, and help stakeholders implement core components of practical guidelines for using MC BSs/BFs during (transitional-)organic vegetable production.

2016-06199: The Development of an Organic Crop Budgeting Tool to Help Advise Producers. Budgets are one of the most important tools producers use when deciding on which crops to grow. Objective in this project is to determine the production practices of organic producers, collect price information about the needed inputs, develop a crop budgeting tool, and produce organic crop budgets so that the profitability of organic crops can be estimated for a producer. This contribution is significant because the team is developing a regionalized database of inputs and prices for organic crop production that doesn’t currently exist and integrating this database into an organic crop budgeting tool that will make it significantly easier for producers and Extension personnel to estimate organic profitability.

2016-06181: Developing advanced perennial legume-grass mixtures harvested as stored feeds to improve herd productivity and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in organic dairies in the Northeast. This project will fill knowledge gaps by advancing the scientific understanding about how potential changes in species persistence and forage botanical composition in various legume-grass mixtures across multiple years affect forage quality and stored feed fermentation characteristics and, consequently, milk production and greenhouse gases emissions when fed to organic dairy cows. The team will partner with three organic dairy farmers in the Northeast who will set up demonstration plots and coordinate field days, thus becoming peer leaders in their rural communities.

aka Organic Transition Program (ORG) FDC ""51106""

For Fiscal Year (FY) 2017:
2017-03405: Going underground:  Perennial and Annual Organic Transition Systems to Optimize Soil Health, Carbon Sequestration, and Profitability Production. Farmers interested in transitioning from conventional to organic systems are faced with unique challenges regarding weed control, fertility, improving soil health, and generating income during the transition period. Many transition systems rely on tillage to control weeds and annual crop rotations, which have been associated with soil carbon (C) loss. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG) is a cool-season grass that is being bred for increased seed yields to become the first perennial grain crop. IWG could help producers overcome the challenges of organic transition, while also simplifying management, reducing tillage-associated C emissions, and improving soil health relative to annual crop-based organic transitions. This study will compare six organic transition systems that include IWG, summer and winter annuals, perennial legumes, and systems with various combinations of grain, forage, and cover crops.

2017-03371: Facilitating improved environmental and soil quality through increased biodiversity and crop/livestock integration on organic farms. Agricultural systems that restore biodiversity improve sustainability and lower dependence on external inputs, which is vital in organic production. The focus of this project is to investigate the effects of integration of cover crops and livestock grazing on soil quality and crop yield. Results will be utilized in the development of educational programs on organic crops, livestock and soil health through university curriculum development, courses on organic principles and practice, open-source learning modules, and producer outreach. The educational programming will improve understanding of organic principles by students who are both today’s consumers and tomorrow’s farmers and future drivers of agricultural policies and practices. Intermediate and long-term outcomes include producer adoption of practices increasing on-farm biodiversity, leading to greater economic and environmental stability in organic production.

2017-03378: Development of effective biological control of fire blight for the Eastern United States. Fire blight is a devastating disease of apples and pears. The termination of antibiotics in organic production requires alternative management options. Biological control represents an important group of organic management tools. Yet, none of the available biocontrols has provided consistent, high level of control against fire blight under humid climates in the Eastern U.S. This study will perform the first comprehensive search and testing for bacterial and fungal biocontrol strains isolated from apple stigmas under humid climate in Eastern U.S. Using a combined approach of antibiosis screen, crab apple bioassay, and metagenomics, the research team will identify microorganisms with antimicrobial producing abilities and preemptive exclusion properties. 

2017-03409: An ecological approach to disease risk management on organic poultry farms. Outdoor poultry are exposed to parasites and pathogens in the soil, or vectored by wild birds. These infections endanger animal and human health. There have been very few holistic studies of factors that make organic poultry farms susceptible or resistant to parasite/pathogen invasion. Growers’ inability to predict and manage these risks forms a major barrier to organic transition. This study will (1) Measure frequencies of poultry contact with wild birds and soil; (2) Survey pathogen and parasite communities within on-farm wild bird populations, while characterizing transmission routes between wild and domesticated birds; and (3) Characterize properties of soil that affect persistence of fecal-borne poultry parasites and pathogens.

2017-03389: Introducing organic to producers of grain-only and pasture-grain wheat cropping systems of northern Texas. Organic agriculture is nearly absent in the northern Southern Great Plains region of Texas, despite large demand for organic products that could be produced there and low producer incomes. The team proposes to utilize a systems approach to directly compare conventional grain-only and ",,,,,,,

","In Fiscal Year (FY) 2002, a panel of USDA scientists knowledgeable in the Nation's plant and animal disease diagnostic capability, recommended to the Secretary a plan of initiating a comprehensive national network of laboratories for the rapid detection and diagnosis of plant and animal diseases. The institutions selected by the panel for initial inclusion in the network were recommended using the following criteria: 

(1) Existing scientific capacity; 

(2) Existing laboratory capacity which could be modified to meet Biosafety Level 3 requirements; 

(3) Both animal and plant diagnostic capabilities; 

(4) Geographical location meeting one or more of the following requirements: located in an area with a high risk of disease/pest incursions; located in an area with high concentration of vulnerable agricultural activity; complements or supplements regional Federal laboratory activity or is in an area not effectively served by an existing Federal facility; 

(5) State-of-the-art communication and information technology systems. Must be capable of managing secure communications with other laboratories and central reporting unit; and 

(6) An effective outreach/extension system.

Building Resilience in the Northeast through Double Cropping and Diverse Forage Crop Mixtures.  

The goal of this project is to meet the dry matter and forage nutrient needs of dairy farmers.  Increasing cropping system diversity can increase yield stability and reduce the negative impact of variable weather. Guided by a stakeholder advisory board, the team will conduct farmer-focused socioeconomic research and field experiments on-farm and at research stations in NY, VT, and NH. They will quantify the productivity and economic viability of intercropping with intra- and interspecific mixtures of winter and summer annual forage crops as part of a double cropping system, and compare this double cropping system to perennial-based forage production. The research team will develop farmer resources on organic forage crop production and disseminate the information this new information through innovative extension strategies.

CIOA 2- Carrot Improvement for Organic Agriculture With Added Grower and Consumer Value.  

Organic growers need vegetable varieties that are adapted to organic growing conditions and have market qualities demanded by organic consumers. In carrots, weed competition, nutrient acquisition, nematodes, and disease pressure are particularly critical challenges to both fresh market carrots and carrot seed production, while flavor, appearance, and nutrition are key market qualities. This project will deliver improved carrot varieties for organic producers and consumers; improved understanding of cultivar performance in organic systems; improved understanding of how carrot genotypes interact with the root microbiome to access key nutrients under limiting environments and avoid heavy metal uptake; and a breeding model that may be adapted to other crops for organic cultivar development. Organic farmers, students, and industry stakeholders in six (6) states participate in the breeding, variety trials, and planning aspects of the project. Project results are disseminated nationally. 

Multi-regional risk analysis of farm manure use: Balancing soil health and food safety for organic fresh produce production.  

Certified organic producers rely on manure-based soil amendments for crop nutrients and to maintain soil health. However, use of untreated animal manure in fresh produce cropping systems may introduce foodborne pathogens and increase the risk of foodborne illness for consumers. The project uses an integrated research-extension risk-based approach to address an urgent and critical need to assess current manure use by organic growers and evaluate pathogen survival time relative to soil health status. The long-term goal is to improve the microbial food safety of fresh organic produce (e.g., leafy greens, tomatoes, root vegetables) grown in soils amended with raw manure. The overall objective is to develop a customized risk-assessment based on good agriculture practices, rigorous microbial testing, self-assessment of soil health, and environmental factors. 

Strengthening Organic Farming Infrastructure through Consumer Education, Market Development, and Integrated Extension and Research Programs in the Southeastern Region.

The project brings together a strong team of economists, extension educators, agronomists and horticulturists in the southeast region of the US to expand organic agriculture in the region. The southeast lags behind the rest of the US in production and sales of organically produced products. Tuskegee University, Auburn University, Mississippi State University and North Carolina State University will work together to double the number of certified organic operations in Alabama. This will be accomplished by creating market demand through consumer education and increased marketing efforts. Growth of organic agriculture in the region will be supported and expanded through effective participatory extension activities, which will deliver regionally specific research based production practices.

Understanding Parasite Resistance in Organic Livestock and Using a Systems Approach for Control.  

One (1) of the greatest barriers to organic production of ruminant livestock is the control of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) or parasites. The goals of this project are to:
(1) understand host mechanisms involved in GIN resistance/resilience by examining differences in immune response among susceptible, resilient, and resistant individuals and breed types;
(2) identify genetic loci associated with resistance/resilience; 
(3) further examine successful systems approaches of GIN control, including fall lambing to minimize summer exposure of GIN to lambs, diverse forage and grazing systems to minimize GIN exposure and use secondary plant compounds for control; and 
(4) work with farmers enrolled in the National Sheep Improvement Program to understand tools for selection for GIN resistance. 

Participating farmers are providing 5,000 DNA samples and phenotypes.

Developing Multi-use Naked Barley for Organic Farming Systems.  

The long-term goal of this study is to provide organic gardeners, growers, processors, and consumers with an alternative crop, food, and raw material that will be economically rewarding and sustainable. The team will breed for naked barley and a modest level of &#946;-glucan to create varieties suitable for brewing, feed use, and that will meet FDA guidelines for soluble fiber in human diets. The work will be conducted in five (5) representative regions/states - Pacific Northwest (OR, WA), Upper Midwest (MN, WI) and North East (NY) The outreach efforts will familiarize students, gardeners, growers, processors, and consumers with the benefits of naked barley varieties and provide guidance for capitalizing on the advantages these varieties can offer.

Economic and environmental sustainability of heifer development strategies in pasture-based organic dairy systems. 

Dairy products constitute the second largest sector of the organic agriculture industry in the US. And dairy cow replacement costs are second only to feed costs in magnitude for the average dairy farm: between one-third (1/3) and one-fourth (1/4) of the entire herd is replaced every year. Given the National Organic Program requirement that ruminant animals be managed on pasture and graze daily throughout the grazing season, heifer development within organic systems is more challenging, and more costly than in confinement systems. The primary objective of the project is to innovate new strategies for organic forage-based dairy heifer development, and then to inspire widespread adoption of these practices for enhanced farm sustainability. 

One-two punch for Organic Poultry Processing: Knocking out foodborne pathogens with plant derived antimicrobials and farmer training. 

Both conventional and organic poultry products have been identified as major sources of Salmonella and Campylobacter, the two (2) most common food-borne pathogens in the US. This study aims to reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter on poultry meat/ eggs using plant-derived antimicrobials applied as wash, spray, fumigation or coating treatment at critical post-harvest control points. 

Managing the Most Significant Biotic Challenges for Organic Onion Production Across the Great Lakes Region.  

Organic onions are a highly valuable commodity in the Great Lakes region and their economic viability has been critically threatened by pests and pathogens that are difficult to manage. Stakeholders have identified onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, as the most serious insect pest and Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB), which is caused by Stemphylium vesicarium, as the most important foliar pathogen in this region. The long-term goal of this project is to develop and implement an effective IPM program for onion thrips and SLB that will ensure the sustainability and profitability of organic onion production in the Great Lakes.

Participatory Breeding and Testing Networks: A Maize Based Case Study for Organic Systems.  

This integrated Multi-Regional Project will conduct advanced on-farm research to identify biophysical and social/legal factors influencing the performance of organic maize cultivars and dependent businesses. Objectives are to:
(1)	build capacity that supports a participatory testing and breeding program; 
(2)	conduct a maize-based case study to explore on-farm factors influencing crop fitness and grain quality; and 
(3)	identify and communicate how organizational structures, sharing and intellectual property agreements can promote client-oriented breeding programs to improve our organic seed supply. Important inputs include promising cultivars, experienced advisors, and significant farmer input.

RIIA project: Engineering Teams Optimizing Agricultural Technology

Work proposed herein takes advantage of the strong engineering programs available at the institution to foster the optimization of agricultural technology. Such goal will be achieved by preparing and focusing teams of two (2) to four (4) engineering students to work on specific agricultural science problems impacting the island. Attainment of such objective requires the establishment of a curricular sequence in Agricultural Science that allows Engineering students to grasp fundamental knowledge of agriculture. The curricular sequence includes a capstone/design course that requires application of the Engineering tools to a current problem of the island’s agriculture. Student capstone design project will be identified after interaction with stakeholders (e.g., Extension agents, farmer or professional associations, government officials, industry representatives).

The project starts by testing the strategy at Industrial and Mechanical Engineering with the long-term goal of institutionalizing the improved approach to the various engineering departments at the institution. By intersecting engineering know-how with agricultural opportunity areas, the initiative should impact the island’s economic activity.

RIIA Project: Developing Resident Instruction in Food & Agriculture Related Sciences at Community College.

RIIA funding will continue to support three (3) full-time instructors, which has resulted in increase in enrollment, number of graduates, students receiving scholarships and stipends, and students participating in experiential learning programs. Continued support from RIIA will help to ensure further successes in the institution’s long-term measures. The project goals focuses on three (3) Educational Need Areas (ENA) – ENA (2)
Faculty Preparation & Enhancement for Teaching, ENA (5) Student Experiential Learning, and ENA (6) Student Recruitment, Retention, and Educational Equity. With the ENAs as a guiding tool, the objectives of the project are: to maintain a funding source for faculty; to participate in a Summer Internship project with insular area colleges/universities; to provide local and regional summer internships; to provide Summer Institute scholarships; to provide off-island scholarships for students pursuing Bachelor’s degrees in food and agricultural related sciences; and to provide financial support for faculty and staff professional development. These objectives will help the institution meet its outcomes and overall NIFA objectives of increasing the number and diversity of students pursing degrees in food and agricultural sciences, and enhancing the quality of postsecondary instruction to help meet current and future workplace needs

RIIA project:  Engaging Prebaccalaureate Students in Educational Agricultural Research

The project will engage undergraduate students in educational agricultural research opportunities. Research faculty at the Agricultural Experiment Station will engage students through mentoring them in educational agricultural research within their programs. One (1) of the challenges faced by institutions operating in insular areas is having sufficient resources for many aspects of everyday life and education. In addition to much needed financial support, this RIIA grant will provide undergraduate students with opportunities to develop their problem solving and decision making capabilities and their level of technical expertise to enhance their overall college experience in leadership and to broaden the scope of their education. Students can use their experience in an Agriculture Extension Station (AES) research program to excel in subsequent academic ventures. A student will also be given an opportunity to participate in a summer internship in 2018 at another Insular Area Institution. The select student will be able to learn and experience tropical agriculture from a different region and share their experience upon return with other undergraduate students. Four students will also be selected to visit a continental US university’s main campus and off campus research stations focusing on tropical agriculture to expose them to other students and research institutions.

AGEFEI Project: Rainwater Harvesting, Storage, and Micro-Irrigation for Water Self-Sufficiency

This project will merge existing irrigation infrastructure with rainwater catchment, distribution, and irrigation technologies that provide state-of the-art solutions to water conservation and agricultural sustainability in the hot, humid tropics. They will the construct a farm equipment building for storage and maintenance that will enhance the rainwater catchment capacity of the green water system. The green water system will utilize rainwater catchment, storage, and distribution at the AES field research site that incorporates micro-irrigation technologies. The goal of this proposal is that water use at the AES field research programs (irrigation and livestock consumption) will become self-sufficient from harvested rainwater.

AGFEI Project: A Science Hub Facility for Agriculture and Plant Protection

The project aims to substantially upgrade and modernize the facilities located in a Center for Excellence in Quarantine and Invasive Species, with a view to strongly enhancing the technological aspects of agricultural education and training in the island. The Center for Excellence possesses lab space, greenhouses and a quarantine facility for the study of invasive pests and pathogens, constituting a front line initiative for their control, before they affect the mainland US. The Center is currently host to 12 undergraduate and graduate students, being trained in modern techniques of pest and pathogen detection, monitoring (GIS) and biological and biomolecular characterization, including Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques. The project goals are to: Firstly, to develop networking capability, involving the creation of an improved multimedia classroom in the Library, which will act as hub for live teaching and seminars, teleconferencing, and the creation of online content in both Spanish and English. This will enable groups in diverse parts of the island to easily access and contribute expertise and knowledge. An important function will be to establish connectivity with groups outside the island, in the mainland US, Caribbean region, and rest of the world. Secondly, to implement computational infrastructure that will facilitate high throughput analyses, in particular genomics that may be used as a training tool in undergraduate and graduate research and education. Thirdly, to upgrade existing experimental equipment to the state of the art. This will include digitization and improvement of microscopic equipment, acquisition of high throughput sample processing equipment such as DNA automated extraction for sampling screening and biological process documentation. 

Fiscal Year2016: The final eight (8) RIIA Awards will range from the lowest of $120,979 to the highest of $175,000.

Developing Resident Instruction in Food & Agricultural Related Sciences

The purpose of this project is to: 
(1) increase the number and diversity of students who will pursue and complete a 2- or 4-year postsecondary degree in the food and agricultural related sciences; 
(2) enhance the quality of postsecondary instruction in order to help meet current and future national food and agricultural sciences workplace needs; 
(3) to provide off-island scholarships for students pursuing Bachelor’s degrees in food and agricultural related sciences; and 
(4) to provide financial assistance for faculty and staff professional development. 

Our goal is to increase the enrollment or the number of students who declare ACNR as major.  The number of students who continue to use the student lab is at a steadily increasing rate.

The main objective of the present proposal is to enhance the agriculture, natural sciences and engineering curriculum through the involvement of students and faculty in research projects related to reuse of water resources for agriculture, including experiential learning and K-12 outreach and extension activities.

Audience: Five (5) undergraduates and one graduate student will participate including seven faculty and one-extension personnel. An estimated of 100 K-12 students and 30 K-12 students and teachers will be impacted by the outreach and extension activities.

Activities/Products WATER products involves outreach materials, workshops for training students in research projects, research projects related to wastewater reuse, summer research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students for participating institutions, students internships at USDA, K-12 teachers workshops, K12 students motivational career workshops. Envisioned activities will be aimed at student’s development as well as the consolidation of a robust pipeline to attract, retain and graduate talented minority students from PR and USVI while preparing them for placement in Agriculture-related positions.

Promoting local research and internship experiences in the US for undergraduate students

This project will address the need to provide new learning paradigms and research skills through an undergraduate research program (URP), and a summer internship what will continue increasing the number of applications, enrollments and the retention rates on two campuses of the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). UPR-Mayaguez has the capacity (faculty, laboratory space and equipment) to admit additional students and increase enrollments in the graduate programs, especially in food, agriculture, renewable natural resources and environment fields. Students from UPR-Ag majoring in STEM disciplines will be exposed to the opportunities of applying their basic knowledge to research problems related to FARNRE. Two mid-career young faculty members will be given the opportunity to renew their theoretical and applied knowledge and skills in the areas of assisted reproductive techniques, one, and food science microbiology, the other. They will be able to incorporate the obtained knowledge in their courses and research as well as in their activities as mentors of the URP funded by the project as well as enhance professional relations with the hosting institution. This project is aligned with UPR-M long range goals as they are contained in its mission statement. The present tight fiscal situation at UPR, which is expected to continue, poses a challenge for the funding needed to accomplish the institutional goals established. This project will facilitate the development of inter-institutional partnerships and collaborations between at least three institutions.

Integrated Sustainable Small Farm Training in the Pacific Islands

The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) is an invasive insect that first appeared as a severe economic pest of specialty crops in the Mid-Atlantic in 2010. It has since spread to 43 states and is now a threat to specialty crops across much of the US. This project will improve our knowledge of BMSB risk to crops through enhanced understanding of agroecology and landscape ecology, implement widespread biological control of BMSB with an exotic Asian parasitoid and native natural enemies, and develop management tools and strategies compatible with biological control and informed by risk from landscape factors. We will continue to determine the economic consequences of BMSB damage and how it is reduced by specific management strategies, and deliver science-based information with a robust and diversified outreach program. 
PROTECTING POLLINATORS WITH ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE
Recent scientific and public awareness about the status of domesticated and native pollinators in North America has led to consumers intentionally planting “pollinator-friendly” plants. Identifying ornamental horticulture plants that support pollinator populations will open new markets for growers. This address threats to specialty crop pollinators by: 
(1) identifying pollinator attractiveness of top selling crops; 
(2) filling specific regulatory data gaps for pollinator risk assessment of systemic insecticide residues within ornamental horticulture crops; 
(3) comparing current pest management practices with alternative strategies; 
(4) providing guidance to growers and landscape managers with updated Best Management Practices; and 
(5) developing outreach tools for multiple stakeholder audiences. 

Ultimately, this project will aid in reaching the President’s goal of 7 million acres of restored or enhanced pollinator habitat by providing growers and landscape managers the knowledge to address pests while producing high quality plants for pollinator forage.
SOLID SET CANOPY DELIVERY SYSTEMS: AND EFFICIENT, SUSTAINABLE AND SAFER SPRAY TECHNOLOGY FOR TREE FRUIT
This multi-region project has a national scope completing the development and delivery of Solid Set Canopy Delivery Systems (SSCDS) for high-density tree fruit production and evaluate SSCDS spray coverage for additional perennial fruit crops. SSCDS consist of a network of microsprayers positioned in the tree canopy/trellis and connected to a pumping/mixing station. SSCDS application virtually eliminates applicator exposure common to tractor-based sprayers, while increasing farmers’ ability to apply sprays during critical weather periods. SSCDS would make frequent applications at low rates possible for modern agricultural chemicals, including nutrients and reduced-risk pesticides, to improve efficacy of “soft impact” IPM programs and reduce soil fertilizer levels. The specific objectives for this proposal are:
( 1) Optimize SSCDS technologies for modern orchard architectures for improved spray material application efficacy; 
(2) Determine and test SSCDS applications for standard and novel fruit production operations; 
(3) Determine the economic benefits and costs associated with SSCDS and identify non-economic barriers to grower adoption of SSCDS; and
(4) Develop and deliver extension and outreach activities and materials —including field scale and on-farm demonstrations— to increase producer knowledge and adoption of SSCDS technologies.
FOOD SAFETY INNOVATIONS AND PREVENTIVE CONTROLS DURING FRESH AND FRESH-CUT PRODUCE WASHING, PACKING, AND RETAIL DISPLAY
Foodborne illness outbreaks associated with contaminated produce negatively impact public health, consumer confidence, the produce industry's economic well-being, and progress toward national nutritional goals. To reduce food safety risk, this project holistically addresses key steps in the supply chain where risk factors profoundly impact food safety, and controls are also feasible. Specifically, we will: 
(1) develop and validate preventive controls for cross-contamination during packinghouse and fresh-cut processing operations; 
(2) evaluate food safety improvement in nonimmersive fresh-cut washing; 
(3) advance scientific understanding of fresh-cut washing and sanitizing processes, and develop novel technologies to improve efficacy; 
(4) field-test, in cooperating retail stores, an energy-efficient approach to improve temperature control and prevent pathogen proliferation in fresh-cut leafy greens; and
( 5) perform cost-benefit analysis and outreach to stakeholders to facilitate technology adoption. 
Project outcomes will enable development, validation, and adoption of science- and risk-based food safety standards and control limits, support implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, and benefit consumers, processors, packers, and retailers.
ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT, EVALUATION, AND ADOPTION OF NEW APPLE ROOTSTOCK TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE APPLE GROWERS PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY
The deficiencies of current apple rootstocks create an urgency to develop and adopt new improved rootstocks. Through this project, we seek to accelerate the development, evaluation and adoption of improved apple rootstocks by targeting research areas, not currently being addressed, which will result in more efficient rootstock development and improved implementation by growers and nurseries. We will focus on both evaluating new candidate rootstocks and identifying genetic makers for difficult to phenotype complex root traits like replant disease tolerance, nutrient uptake and partitioning (especially calcium), low/high soil pH and salinity to improve tolerance of rootstocks to these biotic and abiotic stresses, and improve fruit quality of high value cultivars such as ‘Honeycrisp’.

VitisGen2:  Application of Next Generation Technologies to Accelerate Grapevine Cultivar Development

Recent analyses have emphasized the economic and environmental importance of developing new grape cultivars with high fruit quality (FQ) and resistance to powdery mildew (PM). An Advisory Panel of table, juice, raisin and wine grape industry members concurs that high-quality, PM-resistant cultivars are a top priority. The proposed project (VitisGen2) will: i) expand on VitisGen progress in developing novel economic, phenotyping and genetics knowledge and tools related to new grape cultivars; and 
ii) translate these and previous VitisGen innovations into new applications for improving  grape breeding programs and managing existing vineyard plantings. 

The Economics team will evaluate the consequences of introducing new grape traits, including impacts upon cost, yield, revenue, profit, pesticide use, and the environment. The Phenotyping team will develop novel high-throughput methods, and apply these along with proven approaches to characterize a range of phenotypes, such as PM resistance durability and undesirable fruit qualities, as well as locally important traits. The Genetics team will couple phenotyping results with high-resolution genetic maps, which can be combined with genome assembly and RNA-Seq analyses to develop inexpensive, high-resolution markers spanning key genes. Finally, the Outreach team will communicate scientific opportunities and discoveries, and provide stakeholders with knowledge of the benefits of adopting new high-quality PM-resistant cultivars along with new tools for characterizing PM and FQ in their existing plantings. The proposed work aligns with SCRI program goals by utilizing plant breeding and genomics approaches to improve grape characteristics and enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of grape production.

Table to Farm: A sustainable, systems-based approach for a safer and healthier melon supply chain in the U.S.

This project aims to improve the safety and quality of U.S.-produced melons (Cucumis melo L.) and therefore addresses SCRI goals by: strengthening the competitiveness and sustainability of the U.S. specialty crop industry and bolstering consumption of regionally produced specialty crops, expanding the diversity of adapted varieties through breeding, and improving production practices. It is anticipated that this stakeholder-driven approach will lead to development of unique cultivars (with improved quality, safety, and sensory attributes) and increase consumer loyalty and repeat purchasing (SCRI focus areas 1, 3, and 5).   

The proposed project has five (5) objectives: 
(1) Identify and analyze factors influencing consumer behaviors related to melon purchase and consumption; 
(2) Develop cultivars that address producer and consumer needs using genomics-assisted selection and breeding to harness genetic diversity of melon varieties and improve nutritional quality, flavor, safety, and stress resistance; 
(3) Develop region- and cultivar-specific agronomic practices and technologies to improve production efficiency, nutritional quality and safety attributes; 
(4) Identify critical control points and develop pre- and post-harvest strategies to minimize microbial contamination; and
(5) Establish a Center of Excellence Research, Extension, and Outreach Program for Melons with a focus on improving consumer awareness and meeting the consumer demand for safe, high-quality melons that exceed minimum quality standards thereby resulting in profitability for producers and retailers. 

The CAP team spans 13 disciplines and institutions from seven (7) states. We expect that enhancing melon quality, nutrition, and safety, while providing elite cultivars well-suited to regional production and distribution, will benefit producers, processors, distributors, and consumers nation-wide.

Increasing Low-Input Turfgrass Adoption Through Breeding, Innovation, and Public Education

The public desires lower-input turfgrasses that provide functional turf areas while reducing inputs of water, fertilizer, mowing, and pesticides. Our surveys of consumer and public land managers, along with information from industry partners, suggests that having knowledge about the positive benefits of fine fescues, an important group of grasses well suited for low-input environments, is not enough to increase adoption. The long-term goal of this project is to increase the use of well-adapted fine fescue cultivars in sustainable landscapes. In our first objective, we will survey consumers, land managers, and seed producers to identify the barriers preventing them from using fine fescues. In the second objective, we will lead a sustained effort of cultivar development focused on improving important traits utilizing new molecular technologies and proven breeding approaches. The third objective will generate new knowledge about complex interactions between turfgrass genetics and management. Our approach in the fourth objective will use 30 years of  publically available data in an innovative way to improve consumer turfgrass purchasing decisions for improved fine fescue cultivars. Our fifth objective will identify solutions to several turfgrass management barriers that are preventing stakeholders from seeding fine fescues in landscapes and seed producers from growing this specialty crop. Finally, and most importantly, our sixth objective will deliver research-based information to consumers, seed producers, and land managers using new and innovative outreach methods. We will use plant breeding to improve low-input characteristics and increase the production and profitability of this specialty crop over the long-term.

Developing a sustainable stevia industry in the United States

Stevia rebaudiana (stevia) is a rapidly emerging new crop in the U.S., grown for the extraction of sweet-tasting steviol glycosides used as non-caloric sweeteners. Most stevia is currently produced in China, though production is increasing rapidly in the U.S. The combination of a favorable climate and existing infrastructure necessary for stevia production in the southeastern U.S. make this an ideal region for production of high quality stevia needed to meet the increasing demand for steviol glycosides. However, U.S. stevia growers confront multiple challenges, including a lack of varieties developed for U.S. conditions, a paucity of information on optimizing production practices, such as planting density, fertilization, weed and disease control, and a lack of information on costs of production, consumer preferences, and potential profitability. The specific objectives of this proposal, which were developed with stakeholders through an SCRI Planning Grant, are to: 
(1) Develop Best Management Practices to optimize stevia biomass and glycoside production in the southeastern U.S.; 
(2) Develop germplasm and genetic/genomic resources to enable selection and breeding of stevia cultivars adapted to U.S. growing conditions and producing consumer-desired steviol glycosides; 
(3) Develop consumer profile and market potential analyses for U.S. stevia products and determine consumer-preferred combinations of steviol glycosides; 
(4) Develop cost of production estimates for stevia in different cropping systems; and 
(5) Conduct outreach programs for producers, extension service providers, and industry professionals. 

Completing these objectives will contribute substantially to filling the knowledge gaps, and the fostering development of new varieties to meet industry demand for “next-generation” sweeteners.

Integrating anaerobic soil disinfestation, crop rotation and variety for disease management in strawberry production

Strawberry production is a $2.8 billion industry that provides livelihoods for many hundreds of growers and employs over 80,000 workers in the US. The industry was built around the use of fumigants to manage soil borne diseases and pests. Increasing restrictions on fumigant use due to health and environmental concerns make the development of effective reduced/non-fumigant based management systems critical for survival of the industry in the US. This SREP project brings together a national team of researchers and stakeholders to develop and implement effective 
non/reduced fumigant management systems tailored for specific regions, pathogens and pests. 

Biologically-based techniques, notably anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD), crop rotation and cultivar resistance are promising alternatives to fumigation in strawberries; but their efficacy is dependent on environmental and biological variables. Improved understanding of
management/environment/ pathogen/pest interactions with ASD is needed to develop site and pathogen specific management strategies. Any single biological technique is unlikely to provide efficacy in all situations, but combining multiple strategies should increase the reliability of pathogen control. Here we propose to optimize ASD in terms of carbon sources, combined use with biological agents and herbicides, reduced water use, nitrogen dynamics and genotypes, then put these together with crop rotation to design integrated systems targeted for specific regions in California, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Findings from this project will benefit other specialty crops where fumigants are used, and address SCRI priorities: identify and address threats from pests and diseases; improve production efficiency; and research on plant breeding.

# USASpending API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api)[![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/coverage)[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api)

This is the API that will drive the new USAspending.gov. It is currently under active development and not stable. This API is built on Python 3.5+, Django, and Django Rest Framework.

## Built With

**[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards-compliance.

The APIâ€™s backend components currently run on **[Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** or higher. These instructions will walk you through the process of installing Python and creating a Python-based virtual environment to house the API. A virtual environment will isolate the project and its libraries from those running on your local system and prevent potential conflicts.

## Prerequisites

### Assumptions

*Ability to install software on your local machine
*Git familiarity, a good free Git GUI for Mac and Windows is [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
*Knowledge with a command-line interpreter on your machine

### Windows Users

- Though Git Bash  (Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or **Bash on Ubuntu on Windows**)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about] is strongly recommended, 

### Mac Users

- Ensure [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed.

**Other Unix-based OS Users**
- Familiarity with the operating system's package manager, e.g. `apt-get`, `dkpg`.

## Note

*This guide will use the following as assumptions as defaults:*
1. `homebrew` is the default system package manager; if using another Unix-based OS, simply replace `homebrew` with your preferred package manager.
2. `bash` is the default shell; if using a different shell, replace the `bash` references with your preferred shell's equivalent, e.g. `zsh`, `~/.zshrc`

# Development Setup

**Automatic:**
Use your system's package manager, create the database.

        brew install postgresql
        initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -U postgres -E utf8

This will create the following

        host: localhost
        port: 5432
        database: postgres
        username: postgres

The password may be changed by connecting to the database (`psql`) and running the `\password` command.

        $ postgres=# \password
        Enter new password:
        Enter it again:
        $ postgres=#

**Manual (Windows):**

1. Download the correct PostgreSQL installer for your operating system from [EnterpriseDB](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload) (minimum PostgreSQL version supported is 9.6.x).
2. Run the installer. As you proceed through the installation wizard, note your choices for port number, username, and password.
3. Once PostgreSQL is installed, create the database you will use for this project.

More complete install documentation is available on the PostgreSQL [wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides).

## Install Memcached

The API performs query caching via Memcached. If you want to experiment with AWS caching in your development environment, you can find instructions for installing memcached on it's [website](https://memcached.org/). You will also need to install requirements via pip from `caching_requirements.txt` in addition to the other baseline requirements.

# Install Python 3.5

## Python3.5: Automatic Install

        brew update
        brew install python3.5

## Python3.5: Windows/Manual Install

Windows users can download a Python installer here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/  "Python installer downloads")

# Installing Virtual Environment Manager

`direnv` will detect any `.envrc` files in the current directory and load the file, this is useful for exporting paths without cluttering your `~/.bashrc`

## `direnv` Installation

### Automatic Installation (Unix, OSX)

Install `direnv`

        // OSX Homebrew
        brew install direnv

### `direnv` Manual Install 

Download and install direnv from [direnv.net](https://direnv.net/)



*Windows will need to use Git Bash or another Windows shell for this*
Install the virtual environment by appending the following hook to your shell startup profile.

        echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# `venv` setup

`venv` is included in all Python packages after Python 3.3

To use `venv` to instantiate virtual environments automatically, add the following snippet to your `~/.config/direnv/direnvrc`

        layout_python-venv() {
                local python=${1:-python3}
                [[ $# -gt 0 ]] && shift
                unset PYTHONHOME
                if [[ -n $VIRTUAL_ENV ]]; then
                        VIRTUAL_ENV=$(realpath "${VIRTUAL_ENV}")
                else
                        local python_version
                        python_version=$("$python" -c "import platform; print(platform.python_version())")
                if [[ -z $python_version ]]; then
                        log_error "Could not detect Python version"
                        return 1
                fi
                        VIRTUAL_ENV=$PWD/.direnv/python-venv-$python_version
                fi
                export VIRTUAL_ENV
                if [[ ! -d $VIRTUAL_ENV ]]; then
                        log_status "no venv found; creating $VIRTUAL_ENV"
                        "$python" -m venv "$VIRTUAL_ENV"
                fi
                PATH_add "$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin"
        }

This will allow `layout python-venv python3.5` to be appended to your project's `.envrc` file, which is used in the next step.

## *Optional: have git ignore the local files

    git config --global core.excludesfile "~/.gitignore_global"

Add the following to your `~/.gitignore_global` file

        # Direnv stuff
        .direnv
        .envrc


For more information on `direnv`, see its [Github page](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

# USAspending API Backend

## Clone the repo and create the virtual environment

Decide where on your machine you want the USAspending API code to live. From the command line, navigate there and clone the USAspending API repository from GitHub to your local environment:

        git clone https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api.git

Now we will allow `venv` to manage the virtual environment by the following:

        $ echo "layout python-venv python3.5" >> usaspending-api/.envrc
        $ cd usaspending-api
        direnv: error .envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content.

        $ direnv allow
        direnv: loading .envrc

        $ source activate
        (python-venv-3.5.0) $

The `source activate` command will open the virtual environment for usaspending-api. Anything you pip install from this point forward will be installed into the *usaspending-api* environment rather than your machine's global Python environment. Your command line prompt indicates which (if any) virtual environment is active.

*Remember to use `source activate` as you work in the project folder; You can exit the virtual environment by using `deactivate`*

## Install the dependencies

Use `source activate` to open the virtual environment

        $ source activate
        (python-venv-3.5.0) $ pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
  

Install caching dependencies. (This is optional, and should only be done if you have installed Memcached and require AWS caching for development)

```
$ pip install -r requirements/caching_requirements.txt
```

  

Next, configure your local settings. The `settings.py` file will check for an environment variable named `DATABASE_URL`.

  

## Set your virtual environment export commands

Export your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable by appending the following to your `.envrc` file

```
$ export DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASENAME'
```

  

To test your database connection, try running the migrations that come with the project to set up your tables.

```
$ python manage.py migrate
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```
(usaspending-api):~/usaspending-api$ ./manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
Apply all migrations: admin, auth, awards, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
Applying awards.0001_initial... OK
```

Once you've done that, you're ready to start the development server

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

This will run the application at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default. You can change that by passing the host and port number in to the `runserver` command.

you should see something like this:

```
Performing system checks...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
August 22, 2017 - 15:55:33
Django version 1.11.4, using settings 'usaspending_api.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
Now, go to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/awards/` to see the API! There aren't any other urls set up at the moment.

## Running the Test Suite

To run the test suite and confirm that everything is working as expected, make sure you're in the top-level project directory and that your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set, and

run the following from the command line:
```
$ py.test
```

The tests will not run against your database in `$DATABASE_URL`, but against a

temporary database named `test_(your db name)`, which they will create.

## ETL Setup

The Django server has extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes built in as custom management commands. To use them, follow these setup steps:

  

1. Configure the `DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL` environment variable. This is the same process as setting up the API backend. Exporting `DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL` should look like this:

```
$ export DATA_BROKER_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASENAME'
```
